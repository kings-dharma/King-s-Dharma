### Act 1 : Young Love

#### SCENE 1.1 : Story Setup

Valmiki, Luva and Kusa begins telling the story of Dasaratha. As they narrate, characters appear on stage (in the scenes below).

* #### SCENE 1.1.i - Dasaratha & Kaikeyi

  Kaikeyi saves Dasaratha in battle. In return, Dasaratha grants her two boons. Kaikeyi enjoys the King's utmost attention; she is the main Queen after all.

  Dasaratha and Kaikeyi cannot seem to produce an heir. Both are distraught, especially Kaikeyi. She recommends Dasaratha turns to the Gods for help. Dasaratha agrees.

  During the ceremony, Dasaratha gives each of his queens nectar from the Gods. However, Kausalya, gets more than the rest.

* #### SCENE 1.1.ii.a - Life of Young Sita (parallel with Scn. 1.ii.b)

  While visiting among his farmers, Janaka comes across Sita, a baby left in a furrow. Janaka is astounded, and it is clear that he has been looking for a girl; Sita reminds him of his wife.

  (2) Sita grows up around a house of princes; all who are pining for her hand in marriage. Feeling confined, all Sita wants is to start her own life, away from a Man's gaze. (<u>-A- "For the first time in forever"</u>)<sup>1</sup>

  (3) In response, Janaka promises to find her a suitor not for his looks, but for his character. They both agree upon a special *swayamvara*.

* #### SCENE 1.1.ii.b - Life of Young Rama (parallel with Scn. 1.ii.a)

  (2) Flash forward, and the four boys are in their early teens. Dasaratha looks to Rama, the eldest, as he would be the *yuvaraja*. (<u>-A- "My St. Petersburg"</u>)<sup>1</sup>

  (3) Rama and Lakshmana are sent on their first adventure as *kyshatriyas*. Rama saves Ahalya, a maiden stuck as a demon due to her sexual impurity.


#### SCENE 1.2 : Marriage

  Viswamitra, Rama and Lakshmana begin to see the beauty of Mithila across the waters. Sita, sitting dreamily on the other side of the riverbank. Briefly, she sees Rama.

  Rama makes it to the grandeur that is Mithila's outside courtyard. He steps up to Shiva's bow amongst all the handsome suitors. Before him sits Sita. The master of the ceremony and her Fate. Rama attempts to string the bow. Right as the bow shaft makes a crescent shape, it snaps in half.

  Rama turns around and looks into Sita's eyes for the first time; suddenly they are being wed underneath the setting sun and glimmering stars. It' surreal, it's beautiful, it's the beginning of Rama's humanity and Sita's new Love.

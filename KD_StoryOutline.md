## Detailed Outline - Scene Summaries, Transitions & Music Placement

### Act 1 : Young Love

#### SCENE 1.1 : Story Setup

Valmiki, Luva and Kusa begins telling the story of Dasaratha. As they narrate, characters appear on stage (in the scenes below).

* #### SCENE 1.1.i - Dasaratha & Kaikeyi

  Kaikeyi saves Dasaratha in battle. In return, Dasaratha grants her two boons. Kaikeyi enjoys the King's utmost attention; she is the main Queen after all.

  Dasaratha and Kaikeyi cannot seem to produce an heir. Both are distraught, especially Kaikeyi. She recommends Dasaratha turns to the Gods for help. Dasaratha agrees.

  During the ceremony, Dasaratha gives each of his queens nectar from the Gods. However, Kausalya, gets more than the rest.

  (End Valmiki, Luva and Kusa story)

* #### SCENE 1.1.ii.a - Life of Young Sita

  While visiting among his farmers, Janaka comes across Sita, a baby left in a furrow. Janaka is astounded, and it is clear that he has been looking for a girl; Sita reminds him of his wife.

  (2) Sita grows up around a house of princes; all who are pining for her hand in marriage. Feeling confined, all Sita wants is to start her own life, away from a Man's gaze. (<u>-A- "For the first time in forever"</u>)<sup>1</sup>

  (3) In response, Janaka promises to find her a suitor not for his looks, but for his character. They both agree upon a special *swayamvara*.

* #### SCENE 1.1.ii.b - Life of Young Rama

  (2) Flash forward, and the four boys are in their early teens. Dasaratha looks to Rama, the eldest, as he would be the *yuvaraja*. (<u>-A- "My St. Petersburg"</u>)<sup>1</sup>

  (3) Rama and Lakshmana are sent on their first adventure as *kyshatriyas*. Rama saves Ahalya, a maiden stuck as a demon due to her sexual impurity.


#### SCENE 1.2 : Marriage

  Viswamitra, Rama and Lakshmana begin to see the beauty of Mithila across the waters. Sita, sitting dreamily on the other side of the riverbank, briefly sees Rama.

  Rama makes it to the grandeur that is Mithila's outside courtyard. He steps up to Shiva's bow amongst all the handsome suitors. Before him sits Sita. The master of the ceremony and her Fate. Rama attempts to string the bow. Right as the bow shaft makes a crescent shape, it snaps in half.

  Sita turns Rama around and he looks into Sita's eyes for the first time; suddenly they are being wed underneath the setting sun and glimmering stars. It' surreal, it's beautiful, it's the beginning of Rama's humanity and Sita's new-found love for adventure.

### Act 3 : Surpanakha's Tragedy

#### SCENE 3.1 : Rama's Dream
(See draft of script for more detail on transitions)
- ##### SCENE 3.1.i - Dandaka Hut

  Rama, Sita and Lakshmana are at the Dandaka Hut. Rama want to share a dream he had.

  (1) While Lakshmana grabs food, Rama tells Sita a (unknowningly) true story.

  (2) Rama and Sita interlude: Sita sees parallels in Rama's story and their own. Rama continues his narration.

- ##### SCENE 3.1.ii - Young Surpanakha

  (1) Surpanaka roams a repulsive Lanka. She flees North and finds Vidyutjivha, a *danavan* prince.

  They immediately fall in love. (-?- 'Only Us')

  (2) Surpanakha and Vidyutjivha decide to go to Lanka to get married. However, as they are about to say vows...

  Vidyutjivha attempts to murder Ravana. Ravana reflexively chops Vidyutjivha's head off. He sees Surpanaka's pendant (has a *danavan* seal on it) and declares Surpanaka a traitor in front of her entire family. She flees back to the forest.

- ##### SCENE 3.1.iii - Surpanakha's Error

  Surpanakha finds her way to the Dandaka Hut. Rama, Sita and now Lakshmana are still engaged in the story. Surpanakha reveals herself by finishing Rama's sentence (Rama's 'dream' catches up to the present). She sees Vidyutjivha in Rama and attempts to convince Rama to escape with her. The three make fun of Surpanaka, she lunges at Sita, and Lakshmana cuts off her nose.

  (3) Surpanakha returns to Lanka.

#### Scene 3.2 : Sita's Abduction

- ##### SCENE 3.2.i - Young Ravana

  (3) Inadvertently following Surpanakha's path, Young Ravana wanders from town to town, deep in his books, attempting to learn weaponry, chants and dances to Shiva, among others.<sup>2</sup> People frown upon him for trying to be a Man when he is born as a *rakshasa*.

  Eventually, Ravana ages into a self-made Emperor. He walks up to a weeping Surpanakha on the floor of his court room.

- ##### SCENE 3.2.ii - Surpanakha & Ravana Plot

  Ravana dismisses his ministers and helps Surpanakha to his throne. She tells him about her new-found hatred towards the *kyshatriyas*. She talks about Sita and her perfect life (-?- TBD).

  Both Ravana and Surpanakha plan to take Sita; Rama has the power Ravana wants, and in her envy, Surpankha wants Rama to herself, even though she knows it's not to be.

- ##### SCENE 3.2.iii - Rama's Wrath

  Back at the Dandaka Hut, Rama and Lakshmana play dice.<sup>3</sup> Lakshmana sees a deer that he thinks is Mira. It is not Sita's friend, but she wants Rama to capture it anyways, as it is decievingly gold. To decide, Rama turns to the dice: if the results are doubles, then he will go after the elusive deer. He rolls a snake-eyes. Rama runs after the deer.

  Lakshmana and Sita bond over a light conversation waiting for Rama.

  As Rama finally hits the deer with his arrow, he notices the deer was in fact an illusion; a woman cries out. Rama rushes up to the unknown woman, shouting for Lakshmana and Sita to help him rescue the woman from certain death. As he is tending to the blood and wounds, the woman reaches up to kiss Rama, although she stops before sealing the gap. Rama notices who it is and is stunned.

  On her last dying breath, Surpanakha apologizes and tells Rama that he is 'too late' (implied: to save Sita)

  Back at the hut Lakshmana and Sita are arguing over whether or not Lakshmana should find Rama. Lakshmana eventually goes against his will under Sita's accusation that he has been plotting to marry her and kill Rama.

  While trying to make his way back to the hut, Rama sees a ring fall from the sky and kill a lovebird who was in the middle of mating. It mortifies him. The ring is Sita's.

  Lakshmana catches up to Rama and finds him gravely angry. The men make it back to the hut, and Rama instructs Lakshmana to go find Sita.

  Rama contemplates how he must now be the hardened kyshatriya he was destined to be, and not the humantiarian prince of the forest (-?- 'No Good Deed').

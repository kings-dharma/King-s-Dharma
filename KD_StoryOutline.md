### Act 1 : Young Love

#### SCENE 1 : Story Setup

Valmiki, Luva and Kusa begins telling the story of Dasaratha. As they narrate,
characters appear on stage (in the scenes below).

* #### SCENE 1.i - Dasaratha & Kaikeyi

  Kaikeyi saves Dasaratha in battle. In return, Dasaratha grants her two boons.
  Kaikeyi enjoys the King's utmost attention; she is the main Queen after all.

  Dasaratha and Kaikeyi cannot seem to produce an heir. Both are distraught, especially
  Kaikeyi. She recommends Dasaratha turns to the Gods for help. Dasaratha agrees.

  During the ceremony, Dasaratha gives each of his queens nectar from the Gods. However,
  Kausalya, gets more than the rest.

  Janaka is astounded, and it is clear that he has been looking for a girl; Sita reminds him
  of his wife.

  Feeling confined, all Sita wants is to start her own life, away from a Man's gaze.

    Ahalya, a maiden stuck as a demon due to her sexual impurity.

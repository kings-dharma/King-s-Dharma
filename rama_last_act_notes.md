# Questions

- Should Rama get the satisfaction of having Sita take the test in front of people, or should she take her life alone/privately in the  forest?
- How do we make sure to avoid the argument that Sita's agency can only come from suicid?
	- Sita's abandonment was fated (as proposed by Bhavabhuti)
		- **Modern Spin? What if Rama knew his own fate and tried to change it?**

# *Rama's Last Act* Notes

- "The need to act and the sense that everything has always alreayd been enacted" (51)
- Rasa: Pity
- Bhava: Sorrow+




# Potential Timeline

## Opening

1. Brahmin brings Rama a dead child. Curses Isvhaku clan.

2. Rama behends Sambuka in Panchavati. It reminds him of Sita. Swears to 'build dharma' and to purify himself as that is what Sita would have wanted. Hears Lava and Kusa singing.

3. Lava and Kusa sing the Ramayana to Rama (& Company).


## Climax to Close

1. On his own, Rama asks Lava and Kusa what Fate has in store for him. Lava and Kusa tell him about his Future with Sita.

2. Rama asks for Sita. She takes her life.

3. After his Rage, Rama learns that no matter what he can do, nothing can change the workings of Fate.

4. Lakshmana assures Rama that his rule was of design. Lakshmana dies.

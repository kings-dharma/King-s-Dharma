EXT. VALMIKI'S HERMITAGE.

     VALMIKI is chanting an ancient tune. His eyes are closed in
     meditation.

     Two twin boys enter with kindling. It's sunset, and they are
     laughing among

     Hearing Valmiki's tune, KUSH begins to beat the sticks in rythmn,
     and LUV dances with a stringed instrument. Valmiki smiles and
     looks to the

                VALMIKI
You boys are truly as playful as your Grandfather!

     (The Opening Number begins)

                KUSH
            (mimicking a warrior's move)
Could he do this?

                VALMIKI
Come and find out!

     Valmiki begins to sing about Dasaratha, how he wooed Kaikeyi,
     and how after the War, Dasaratha became King, Kaikeyi lead
     Queen. Luv and Kush continue their playing and harmonize
     Valmiki.

     Ghostly figures appear on stage and surround the trio, reenacting
     the story. It's elegant, mythical, and reminds us of shadow
     puppetry.

                VALMIKI
            (spoken interlude)
And so, he gave each of his Queens the nectar of the Gods in hopes to
produce an heir. But, one Queen got more than the rest, and queen Kaikeyi
would never forget that

     DASARATHA is seen giving a larger portion to KAUSALYA
     while KAIKEYI

     Simultaneously, we see JANAKA working his own fields. He sees
     BABY SITA buried in a furrow. Valmiki sings about how Janaka
     was awaiting a daughter--a daughter that would remind him of his
     deceased

     BABY RAMA is born, and everyone's attention is on him and
     Kausalya. The rest of THE BOYS are born shortly after, but the
     King's attention is no longer on

     (End ghost story)


INT. MITHILA PALACE

     Suddenly, a young princess SITA takes center stage. Living around
     all women, she's excited to find a man.

                SITA
   A YOUNG PRINCE IN WHITE,
   FOR ME, SITA,
   GOING SOMEWHERE,
   GOING FAR,
   
   HOW IT MUST FEEL TO ADVENTURE WHEREVER YOU
   PLEASE,
   FEELING AS FREE AS A BIRD SOARING ABOVE THE TREES,
   EVEN THE FISH IN THE SEA MUST BE LONGING TO FLY,
   CATCHING A MOMENT WITH A YOUNG PRINCE IN WHITE
   TRAVELING
   
   OH GOD, DEAR GOD,
   ARE YOU THERE?
   WHAT CAN I DO TO GET YOU,
   TO LOOK DOWN AND GIVE IN?
   
   OH GOD, DEAR GOD,
   HEAR MY PAYER,
   I WAS BORN IN A FIELD
   FROM MY MOTHER, THE EARTH,
   SO MY FATE BEGINS HERE...
   I'M WAITING FOR LIFE TO BEGIN!


INT. AYODHYA PALACE

     Dasaratha's four young boys enter the palace; the three follow
     RAMA, a prince of Sita's age.

                RAMA
   MOTHER'S BEGRUDGING SO
   FATHER ACCEPTS WHAT HE GETS.
   
   GRATEFUL FOR PEACE IN HIS COURT
   MOTHER HATES ARGUMENTS.
   
   AS THE ELDEST I PROMISE
   AS KING OF AYODHYA,
   I WILL PROVE THAT
   MY DUTY WILL GO ABOVE ALL .


INT. MITHILA PALACE

                SITA
   A YOUNG PRINCE
   FACING DESTINY,
   REACHING TO PLACES,
   THAT ARE MEANT TO BE!
   
   MY YOUNG PRINCE,
   ONE DAY YOU WILL ARRIVE,
   MY HEART WILL STOP,
   WITH YOU I'M OFF
   ONWARD WE'LL FLY
   WE'LL FLY!

     King JANAKA enters. Orchestration continues.

                SITA
Father! Father! You called?

                JANAKA
Happy birthday, my dear! Sixteen, is it now?

                SITA
What did you get me?

                JANAKA
            (reaching into his pocket)
Hmm, I think I know...

                JANAKA
Ah-hah!

     Janaka pulls out a ring. It's his Wife's.

                SITA
What is it?

                JANAKA
It's your Step-Mother's. It was the ring I gave her when we first met.

     Sita takes the ring. It is as radiant as the sun.

                SITA
Does that mean...

                JANAKA
Yes, it is time for you to wed.

                SITA
Oh, Father!

                JANAKA
And, just like your Step-Mother, you shall get to choose your husband.


INT. MITHILA / AYODHYA PALACE

                SITA / RAMA
   OH GOD, DEAR GOD,
   PLEASE BE THERE.

                RAMA
   DON'T LET ME FORGET THE MAN THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO
   BE.

                SITA
   WAKE UP!

                RAMA
   LOOK DOWN!

                SITA / RAMA
   HEAR MY PRAYER

                RAMA
   DON'T SINGLE ME OUT

                SITA
   AND THEN FORGET ME!

                SITA / RAMA
   OH GOD, DEAR GOD,
   LET ME FLY!

                SITA
   SEND ME TO PLACES WHERE NO ONE BEFORE ME HAS
   BEEN
   YOU SPARED MY LIFE; SHOW ME WHY.

                RAMA
   YOU URGE ME TO BE THE BEST I CAN BE
   THEN TELL ME TO WAIT
   WELL, I'M WAITING...

                SITA / COMPANY
   ....WAITING!

                SITA / RAMA
   WAITING FOR LIFE TO BEGIN!
   WAITING FOR LIFE TO BEGIN!


INT. DASARATHA'S COURT

     (viswamitra  + dasaratha duet)

                VISWAMITRA
My Lord, the boy is sixteen. You must let Fate take its course.

                DASARATHA
He is my son, revered Viswamitra, he is still a child! How can we be certain
that he will be safe with you? Rakshasas are unforgiving!

                VISWAMITRA
He is destined to fight demons. He is not an ordinary child, Dasaratha!  ....

                DASARATHA


                DASARATHA
            (defeated)
You are right. I must learn to control my attachment for the greater good of
my

     Rama and Lakshmana enter.

                DASARATHA
Rama, Viswamitra needs a kyshatriya's prowess to kill some demons that
have been terrorizing the sages. You must go with him.

                RAMA
Yes, Father.

                LAKSHMANA
            (grabbing Rama)
What about me? You can't take Rama without me!

                VISWAMITRA
Yes, you may join your brother.

     The boys leave with Viswamitra. Dasaratha holds his breath.


EXT. LANKA MARKET

     Teen Surpanakha and Ravana race through the Lanka Markets.
     Vibhishana is trying to catch them. Both hold sticks as swords,
     swiping the enemies that are the stall vendors.

                RAVANA
            (to a stall vendor)
One of these days, you will bow down to me! Even the Devas will bow down
to

                VIBHISHANA
Master Ravana, I do not want to squash your hopes, but--

                SURPANAKHA
            (to Vibhishana)
Master Ravana: King of Devas, Men, and Demons--King of the Universe!

('Just Can't Wait to be King' sung by Caleb Hyles (cover). Modified lyrics are
in as a placeholder and will not be in the final stageplay.)

                RAVANA
   I'M GONNA BE A MIGHTY KING,
   SO ENEMIES BEWARE.

                VIBHISHANA
   WELL I'VE NEVER SEEN A KING OR DEVA
   WITH SUCH A DEMON'S GLARE.
   
   I'M GONNA BE THE MAIN EVENT,
   LIKE NO KING WAS BEFORE.
   THE DEVAS WILL BE LOOKING DOWN,
   WHEN THEY HEAR MY BATTLE HORN.

                VIBHISHANA
   THUS FAR, A RATHER HOPELESS THING

                RAVANA
   OH, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING!

                VIBHISHANA
   YOU HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IF YOU WANT A CHANCE--

                RAVANA
   NO ONE SAYING, 'DO THIS,'

                VIBHISHANA
   NOW WHEN I SAID THAT, I--

                SURPANAKHA
   NO ONE SAYING, 'BE THERE,'

                VIBHISHANA
   WHAT I MEANT WAS--

                RAVANA
   NO ONE SAYING, 'STOP THAT,'

                VIBHISHANA
   LOOK, WHAT YOU DON'T REALIZE--

                SURPANAKHA
   NO ONE SAYING, 'SEE HERE,'

                VIBHISHANA
   NOW SEE HERE!

                RAVANA
   FREE TO RUN AROUND ALL DAY,

                VIBHISHANA
   WELL, THAT'S DEFINITELY OUT--

                RAVANA
   FREE TO DO IT ALL MY WAY!


INT. LANKA PALACE

     Ravana and Surpanakha are running through the halls.

                VIBHISHANA
   I THINK IT'S TIME THAT YOU AND I
   ARRANGED A HEART TO HEART.

                RAVANA
   KINGS DONT NEED ADVICE
   FROM GRUMPY MINISTERS FOR A START.

                VIBHISHANA
   IF THIS IS WHERE MONARCHY IS HEADED
   COUNT ME OUT
   OUT OF SERVICE, OUT OF LANKA
   I WOULDN'T HANG ABOUT
   THIS CHID WILL BECOME A PITTIED THING

                RAVANA
            (makes it to the empty throne)
   OH, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING!

     A messenger brings Ravana a note.

                RAVANA
A princess in Mithila is hosting a swayumvara. My future Queen!

                VIBHISHANA
            (on deaf ears)
Master, I do not think the stars have it in for you. She's a warrior's princess!

                SURPANAKHA
Let's go!


EXT. DANDAKA FOREST

     The trio are travelling in the Dandaka forest to Mithila. Ravana is
     wearing his finest, commoner's

                SURPANAKA
   EVERYBODY LOOK LEFT
   EVERYBODY LOOK RIGHT
   EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK HE'S

                RAVANA
   STANDING IN THE SPOTLIGHT!

                VIBHISHANA
   NOT YET!

                SURPANAKHA
   LET EVERY CREATURE GO FOR BROKE AND SING
   LET'S HEAR IT IN THE HERD AND ON THE WING
   IT'S GONNA BE LORD RAVANA'S FINEST FLING!

                RAVANA
   OH, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING
   OH, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING
   OH, I JUST CAN'T WAIT...
   TO BE KING!


EXT. MITHILA COURTYARD

     Princely Suitors line up to try and string Shiva's bow. Among them,
     Vibhishana, Ravana and Surpanakha are the only demons there.

                VIBHISHANA
Master, I would advise just watching. That bow is of Godly power. I can just
feel

                RAVANA
Mister Vibhishana, I don't care what other people think. If I want to try and
string that bow, then I will. There is pride in trying something that isn't in
your

                SURPANAKHA
            (sees Vidyutjihva)
Brother, please string that bow. Then I may have one of the handsome
suitors

                JANAKA
Sita, have you chosen yet?

                SITA
No. They're all the same. They flex their muscles, lick their lips, and hide after
they can't move the bow an

                JANAKA
Do not fret. We will find someone eventually.

                GUARD
Next-!

                SURPANAKHA
Good luck, King Ravana!

     Rama, Lakshmana and Viswamitra enter. Rama's gaze immediately
     goes towards Ravana as he approaches the legendary bow.

     Once on the podium, Ravana considers casting a mantra but
     hesitates.

                RAVANA
Play fair. That's the right way.

     Ravana attempts to lift the bow; he has gotten the farthest out of
     all the suitors before him. His gaze lands on Sita and her beauty.

                RAVANA
Lakshmi Devi?

     Ravana loses his grip and falls over. A mocking outburst can be
     heard from the crowds. He shrinks back to Vibhishana and
     Surpanakha.

                JANAKA
Good grief. They cannot seem to take their eyes off you, can they?

                GUARD
Next-!

                VISWAMITRA
            (to Rama)
My boy, you must go up and string that bow. Only then can you prove
worthy to your future

                LAKSHMANA
That bow is huge! Rama, if you can lift that, you can conquer anything!

                LAKSHMANA
            (to his mesmerized brother)
Rama?

                RAMA
Oh, yes, sir.

     Rama slowly approaches podium.

                JANAKA
Ah, there is one more.

     Sita looks at Rama. Their gaze has not yet met, but Sita knows.

                SITA
This will be the one.

                JANAKA
What? He looks so young.

                SITA
Just watch, Father.

     Rama hovers his hands above the bow. The chemistry is so strong
     it's visible; it's as if the bow was meant just for him. The heavenly
     bow snaps itself into Rama's

     As if the bow was made of feathers, Rama lifts the bow upright.
     But the minute he loosens his grip in preparation to string the bow,
     the bottom stabs a crack in the

     With the bow sticking upright in the ground, Rama attempts to
     string it. As the bow bends to a crescent, it snaps. A shockwave
     radiates through everything and

(Begin wedding song in the liveliness of Bollywood's 'Baari Barsi')

                SITA
            (excitedly getting up)
Yes, he's the one!

     While everyone congradulates Sita for finding a husband, Rama
     desparately tries to recover the broken bow. Sita comes up from
     behind him holding a handful of blue lotuses and water lilies. She
     taps him on the shoulders. Rama turns around and immediately
     blushes at her

     Sita hands him the flowers and gives him a kiss. It's as if two
     ancient lovers have

                SITA
Would you do me the honor of being my prince?

                RAMA
Yes, I would love that.

                SURPANAKHA
He did it. He broke the bow of the Devas. It's as if he is one himself, don't
you

                RAVANA
Yeah, he broke it effortlessly.

                            ACT 2


INT. RAMA'S OFFICE - YEARS LATER

     Officer Rama, now in his twenties, sits at his plain desk reviewing
     proposals for a new set of laws. Besides his scrolls and a quill,
     bright lotuses float in a

                SITA
Ah, there he is!

                RAMA
Hello, my love, how can I help? I am quite busy reading these amendments.
They need to be passed as soon as possible. The word on the street is that
domestic violence has become more of a problem, and we currently do not
have any robust standards in place.
            (picking up the paperweight that are
             the amendments in one, unnaturally
             strong
These are for the women of Ayodhya.

                SITA
Clever, clever. Have you gotten to mine yet?

                RAMA
You wrote one?

                SITA
Yes, but don't tell anybody.

                RAMA
            (shuffling through the scrolls)
Is it under your name?

     Sita goes to lean up against the back of his desk, and pushes aside
     the

                SITA
Of course not. I'm not telling you which one it is, either. Come, let's go for a
walk. You've been in here all week. I miss being with you.

                SITA
We can find those favorite flowers of yours.

                RAMA
You mean, the ones you stuffed my face in during your swayumvara?

                SITA
            (reaching for the flowers in the vase)
If I do it again will you come?

     Rama stands up and turns Sita's face for a kiss. He takes her hands
     in

                RAMA
I don't need those, my flower.

                SITA
That's the right attitude!

     Hand in hand, Sita swiftly leads Rama out of his office, his scrolls
     hitting the floor. On the way, they pass Manthara walking to
     Kaikeyi's


INT. KAIKEYI'S ROOM

     Kaikeyi is sitting at her vanity. Manthara comes in with fresh linens.

                MANTHARA
Ugh, you should see those two.

                KAIKEYI
Who?

                MANTHARA
That half-son of yours. The one always fawning over Sita.

                KAIKEYI
Manthara, please save it. I am trying to be in a good mood for dinner tonight.

                MANTHARA
The one where Kausalya will be in between you and King Dasaratha?

                KAIKEYI
Yes, but that is not an excuse to be unaproachable.

                MANTHARA
The head queen should sit beside her King, not next to one of her mistresses.
Don't you think it's a bit

                KAIKEYI
What?

                MANTHARA
That he prefers Kausalya over you, and her son will be king? The son who
goes on romantic romps instead of tending to princely duties, while Bharata,
your son, is deep in literature and study. This was always the case, even when
they were children: Rama and Lakshmana would be goofing off with the
sages, while Bharata was left studying politics with our minster Vaishishta.

                KAIKEYI
What are you implying this time Manthara? You're such a martyr...

                MANTHARA
Bharata should be king, Kaikeyi, and you know it. That's the only way you
can secure your role as the head
            (finding Kaikeyi's soft-spot)
Dasaratha has forgotten his love for you because he's been blinded by his
love for Rama, a son by an inferior queen! Kaikeyi, you should have been the
mother of the eldest! Not

     Manthara's argument hits home.

                KAIKEYI
What should I do?

     (kaikeyi/manthara duet)

                MANTHARA
After all these years and all the Kings that I have served, I have never seen a
queen so powerful as yourself, Kaikeyi. Use your boons.

                KAIKEYI
Those were--I didn't need to be bribed by boons to save his life in battle. He
gave them to me as a courtesy, a way to say 'I love you.'

                MANTHARA
What love? He offered them, so use them. If he loves you, he will hold his
word. Ask for Rama to be banished for fourteen years in the forest. That
way, it will give enough time to demonstrate Bharata's ability to be king, and
you will become the Head Queen

                KAIKEYI
Yes, I will be head queen by the end of the day!


INT. AYODHYA GRAND HALL

     Kaikeyi walks in for dinner. Like what Manthara described, she sits
     in between Kausalya and Sumitra. Dasaratha sits at the head of the
     table.

                KAIKEYI
My Lord, how was your day?

                DASARATHA
Pleasant! Went on a nice walk through the markets. Ran into Rama and Sita!
I'm so glad she got him out of that dismal office; that man works too hard.
Where were you today? I wanted to invite you to walk with us.

                KAIKEYI
Oh, apologies.

     Three brothers enter the room. Rama and Sita are arm-in-arm.
     Bharata is no where to be

                DASARATHA
There are my boys! Rama, son, come to your ol' father!

                RAMA
Hello, Father.

                DASARATHA
Come, sit! I have important news for you all.

     The boys and their wives sit at the table. Rama sits right across
     from

                DASARATHA
As you know, your father is getting quite old. So, after talking with my
people, it seems that we have all come to the consensus that Rama should be
the heir to the throne. He is the people's choice and my dearest son.

     A roar of applause by everyone, including the servants. Kaikeyi
     looks

                DASARATHA
So, let us not dally! I want Rama shall be crowned yuvaraja tomorrow!

                KAIKEYI
            (crying)
My Lord!

     A stunned silence.

                DASARATHA
Kaikeyi? What's wrong?

                KAIKEYI
            (to a servant)
You, find Bharata.

                KAIKEYI
My two boons from long ago--that night I saved your life--do you
remember?

                DASARATHA
Yes, of course!

                KAIKEYI
Well, I want to use them now.

                DASARATHA
Love, I have always sworn you could have whatever you want! Why the tears?
What is

                KAIKEYI
            (seething)
Listen carefully, then. I want Bharata to be crowned and Rama banished to
the forest for fourteen years. Dasaratha, prince of dharma, do not break your
word, else you will bring misfortune to the entire Ishvaku lineage, including
Rama.

     Utter silence.

                DASARATHA
            (to his servants)
Leave us.

     Servants quickly exit the room. Dasaratha looks into Kaikeyi's eyes;
     it's like looking into the depths of

                DASARATHA
What has Rama done to deserve this? Who are you?

                KAIKEYI
Your head queen!

     It has finally caught up to Dasaratha.

                DASARATHA
Please, take it back! I will give you anything else, just please not this! Please,
my love, please, not my

     Rama comforts Dasaratha.

                KAIKEYI
No more of your sweet talk! You uphold your word or I tell everyone in
Ayodhya that their King is a

                RAMA
Mother Kaikeyi-! Please, you did not have to put Father through this. If you
had only asked, I would have gone to the forest without second thought.

                LAKSHMANA
            (to Rama)
You can't be serious.

                RAMA
Why wouldn't I be serious?

                LAKSHMANA
It's... ridiculous! You deserve the throne, Rama! That's how kingship works!

                SITA
Then are you suggesting we disobey our Mothers?

                LAKSHMANA
Sita, you too?!

     Kausalya begins to weep. Sita and Lakshmana rush to her side.

                KAIKEYI
You leave tonight. Bark clothes like the rishis.

                RAMA
            (sternly)
Calm yourself, Mother Kaikeyi. Allow us this moment to say good-bye, then
we shall

                SITA
            (privately to each other)
I'm coming with you, right?

                RAMA
You want to come? Sita, it's fourteen years.

                SITA
Rama, if I can write a piece of legislation which you approved of, I think I am
smart enough to make my own

                RAMA
            (smirks)
Fair. Alright.

                RAMA
            (publicly, in high-spirits)
Sumantra, ready the chariot. Fate has declared we stay in the forest for
fourteen years. Nobody can escape the workings of Fate, and only Time will
tell what will come of it.
            (looking over to Sita)
We might as well enjoy it while we can.

                LAKSHMANA
At least you will have me, too.

                RAMA
Glad you said that. What would I do without you both?

                DASARATHA
Rama, please, my son, stay. I do not know what to do without you.

                RAMA
Do not worry, Father. It will only be fourteen years. Bharata will make an
excellent King; he is wise in the knowledge of politics. He will help you sort
through

     Rama and Lakshmana dress into simple clad clothes. Only
     Lakshmana carries weaponry, and Sita wears simple, but royal,
     robes. They exit the palace and get on the chariot with Sumantra.

     Sita begins to hum the tune of 'No Matter What' from their
     wedding (a

                RAMA
            (completing the measure)
   FROM THIS DAY ON,
   UNTIL KINGDOM COME,
   I WILL LOVE YOU
   NO MATTER WHAT.

EXT. VALMIKI'S HERMITAGE

     Luv, Kush and Valmiki sit around the campfire built from the
     wood they collected earlier. It's

                KUSH
How could he be optimistic? He willingly wants to live here?

                LUV
It's not that bad.

                VALMIKI
Well, they actually had to live in a much scarier part of the forest. You see,
after Bharata caught up to them at the edge of Kosala--

                KUSH
He must have been so embarassed.

                LUV
I don't think he had a choice.

                VALMIKI
Fate can be as unpredictable as the sparks that fly from the fire. But, the
sparks always come from one flame--the flame that sustains you and me.
Watch

     With a flick of Valmiki's hands, we see Bharata apologizing
     profusely to Rama for Mother Kaikeyi's actions in the midst of the
     flame.

                KUSH
Woah. Sage Magic.

                VALMIKI
Bharata was a good man put in a tricky situation.

     Valmiki 'scrub's through the film that is the flame. There is a ton of
     'film', most of which is their lives with various hermits.

     Valmiki stops the 'film.' Sita can be seen conversing with Rama at
     the Dandaka

                LUV
Wait, is that...Mother?

                VALMIKI
When she was younger, yes.

                KUSH
Why is she with-?

                LUV
Oh my---

                VALMIKI
            (smiling)
Let us continue...

                            ACT 3


EXTERIOR. DANDAKA HUT.

     RAMA and SITA sit outside of the Dandaka Hut. It's peaceful, as
     every early morning

     Sita is matting and combing Rama's wet tangled hair. It clearly
     hurts, as Sita tightly wraps one strand over the next. Over, under,
     over, under.

     LAKSHMANA comes out of the Dandaka Hut holding makeshift
     tools, hair also wet, but neatly done up in a matted bun.

                LAKSHMANA
That should be it. No more wobbly deck. I just forgot to secure--

     Rama excitedly hugs Lakshmana, forcing Sita to forego the current
     strand.

                RAMA
It's perfect. You did a great job.

                LAKSHMANA
Are you hungry or something? You can't even see it--

                SITA
No, Rama's just a wimp and doesn't want me to finish his hair.

                RAMA
We have all day to finish my hair.
            (returning to Sita)
Especially since I've have a story to tell you, my love.

                SITA
Let me guess, it's a word-for-word retelling of "Vyasa's" apocalyptic future.
Yeah, I think we've heard that one enough times. The Sages' favorite--
            (After second thought)
Pretty sure you're in it too....Wait....

                RAMA
Ha-ha, no, not that one. That one's too long to tell in one sitting, which is
why the Sages had to tell us bits and pieces here and there. No, this one I just
dreamed of last night. Thought you might like it, and maybe Lakshmana
might

                SITA
Ugh, does that mean there's violence?

                RAMA
I promise to keep the violence to the minimum.

                SITA
You better. That's the whole point; remember when we lived with the Sages?
No violence, especially coming from you. If so, you'll scare away Mira.

     The gold deer walks shyly up to Sita. She whispers quietly to it
     which coaxes the deer to lie down with its head in her lap.

                LAKSHMANA
Holler when you get to the spicy parts. I'm going to find food.

     Lakshmana collects his bow and arrows.

                SITA
Don't hunt Mira's friends!

                LAKSHMANA
            (on his way out of sight)
Not everyone can speak to animals, Sita!

                RAMA
Are you ready?

                SITA
Let's hear what you've got.

                RAMA
            (Sitting close to Sita, also stroking
             Mira's
One day, there was a women like yourself: radiant, youthful, hopeful...in love.
It was if she had the world ahead of her--like you do--but for one small
difference: she was born in a demonic world--a world of vanity and
selfishness.

     (Begin orchestration)

     Suddenly, a heavenly golden city surrounds the couple. A YOUNG
     DEMON WOMAN, similar to Sita's age, is shoved out of a
     glistening marble home, crying. Cry elsewhere! can be heard from
     its

     She roams the streets and cautiously attempts to distance herself
     from the drunk, half-naked PEDESTRIANS. From the cracked-
     -open golden doors, raunchy party-goers could be heard.

                RAMA
This world attracted those who wanted to enjoy only the pleasures in life.
Finding herself stuck in this fake reality, the princess fled north, eventually
settling herself in the forest. As fate would have it, she ran into a Danavan
prince named

     In Rama and Sita's place are now VIDYUTJIHVA and
     SURPANAKHA. We are now in the distant past. It's neither night
     or day. Vidyutjihva and Surpanakha are cuddling, both a disheveled
     mess.

                VIDYUTJIHVA
Come again? Your brother is a king? How come you have never mentioned
this to me

                SURPANAKHA
Nobody has bothered to ask about my family. Maybe because I'm not a big
part of it? I've always been the independent sorts, especially since my family
and I disagree about

                VIDYUTJIHVA
Yes, you definitely can hold your own, that's for sure. Somehow, you always
manage to find me when I'm lost, which is quite often and for long periods
of time

                SURPANAKHA
Yes, the forests are not kind to those who do not call them home.

                VIDYUTJIHVA
At this point, maybe I should. I also am not wanted back home. Not until I
prove that I am not a waste of space. That's what happens when you have
three other brothers who are all better in every way, you know? Maybe I
should move to the forest with you. I know I'm not a--

     (Song in the spirit of "ONLY US" performed by Laura Dreyfuss)

                SURPANAKHA
   I DON'T NEED YOU TO SELL ME ON REASONS TO WANT
   YOU
   I DON'T NEED YOU TO SEARCH FOR THE PROOF THAT I
   SHOULD.
   
   I DON'T NEED MORE REMINDERS OF ALL THAT'S BEEN
   BROKEN
   I DON'T NEED YOU TO FIX WHAT I'D RATHER FORGET
   CLEAR THE SLATE AND START OVER
   TRY TO QUIET THE NOISES IN YOUR HEAD
   WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH ALL THAT
   
   SO WHAT IF IT'S US?
   WHAT IF IT'S US
   AND ONLY US
   AND WHAT CAME BEFORE WON'T COUNT ANYMORE OR
   MATTER?
   CAN WE TRY THAT?
   
   WHAT IF IT'S YOU
   AND WHAT IF IT'S ME
   AND WHAT IF THAT'S ALL THAT WE NEED IT TO BE
   AND THE REST OF THE WORLD FALLS AWAY?
   WHAT DO YOU SAY?
   

                VIDYUTJIHVA
   I DON'T NEED YOU TO SELL ME ON REASONS TO WANT
   YOU

     Surpanakha doesn't care that Vidyutjihva is of a different race.
     Rather, he spends the time to

     Similarly, Vidyutjihva is grateful for Surpanakaha's companionship.
     She doesn't care if he is a pitiful

     Surpanakha and Vidyutjihva decide that it would be better to be
     alone in the forest, just the two of them, than to face the reality of
     what the world asks them to be.

                SURPANAKHA
            (half-haphazardly putting on her
             gowns)
Let's go.

                VIDYUTJIHVA
Go where?

                SURPANAKHA
Get up, get up! We're going to make this place your home.

                SITA
            (elsewhere)
Rama, you better not be hinting at something.

                RAMA
            (elsewhere)
What?

                SITA
We are only going to be here for another year. Right?

                RAMA
Oh! Yes. This is...No! No, this is not a story about us. Yes, we will only be
here another

                SITA
We'll see...

                RAMA
Eventually, Surpanakha and Vidyutjihva make it back to the demon world.
For Surpanakha, this would be her first time back since she fled.

     Hand-in-hand, Surpanakha and Vidyutjihva approach a YOUNG
     RAVANA. Both wearing their most elegant gowns. Surpanakha
     introduces

                RAMA
Noticing love in her eyes, the King smiled and decided to wed the two. The
princess has finally discovered the pleasure in love. However, as the King
turned his

     Vidyutjihva lunges at Ravana with a knife. We're suddenly in
     Ravana's great hall, where all of SURPANAKHA'S FAMILY can
     be seen attending the wedding ceremony. The knife nicks Ravana
     in the back. Ravana reflexively brandishes his sword and slices
     Vidyutjihva's head off. Surpanakha screams, and lunges for
     Vidyutjihva, landing right on top of his severed head.

     Ravana notices the pendant around Surpanakha's neck. It has a
     Danavan

                RAVANA
            (to Surpanakha)
You are a traitor.

     Surpanakha continues to weep as the head turns to ash.

                RAVANA
And here in the world of pleasure, we have no room for tears.

     Surpanakha's family jeers.

     We're back at the peaceful Danka Hut. Mira has resorted to
     sleeping on the grass. Rama places his head on Sita's lap.

                RAMA
After being subjugated to such humiliation, Surpanakha again fled the
Demon

                SITA
She didn't deserve to be treated that way.

                RAMA
True. Sometimes fate can be cruel, but only Time will tell. The best thing we
can do is act according to what is

                SITA
            (Speculatively)
Whose to say what's right?

                RAMA
The Sages, our fathers and mothers, our friends... they deserve our utmost
respect. Enacting such respect is the right thing to do. That is what's right.

                SITA
Continue your story.

                RAMA
Why? It only gets uglier.

                SITA
So we don't end up talking in circles about dharma.

                RAMA
Alright...

     Surpanakha has reached the Dandaka Hut still in her beautiful
     garments. She notices Rama and Sita giggling among themselves.

                RAMA
I better get Lakshmana. This is the saucy part!
            (gets up and looks for Lakshmana)
Lakshmana! This will be your favorite part!

                SITA
We finally got there! For once, we've gotten almost to the end!

     Rama nudges Sita jokingly.

     Lakshmana appears from behind the hut carrying a basket of
     berries and other fresh food. He sets it down in front of the
     couple. Rama gingerly opens the basket and immediately begins to
     eat.

     Lakshmana glances over to Sita and smirks.

                LAKSHMANA
You're lucky I was close. Okay, get on with it.

                RAMA
Where was I? Oh! Right: the demon princess fled, for the second time.
Except this time, she was looking for another

                SURPANAKHA
            (coming out of the bushes)
Yes, I am!

                RAMA
--to please her.

     The three turn around and stare at Surpanakha, dressed to the
     nines in, what humans would consider, scandalous--yet
     exceptionally elegant--robes. By her behavior, she is clearly done
     trying to make good

                SURPANAKHA
            (sees Rama)
...Vidyutjihva?

                RAMA
It's Rama. Nice to meet you.

                RAMA
            (in disbelief)
Who are you?

                SURPANAKHA
You know who I am.

                LAKSHMANA
Your name.

                SURPANAKHA
Surpanakha. Wif--Ex-wife of Vidyutjihva. The fomer exiled prince of this
forest.

                SITA
...and you think he's here?

                SURPANAKHA
            (lustfully)
If I pretend hard enough.

     Lakshmana steps in between Rama and Surpanakha to try and ease
     the tension. With Lakshmana's naturally large stance, it only makes
     it

                SURPANAKHA
            (to Sita)
No wonder why Vidyutjihva didn't actually love me. He likes a different type
of

                SITA
Rama is not Vidyutjihva.

                SURPANAKHA
He looks quite alike per my memory. Same physique, same beautiful eyes. Say,
Vid--
            (pointing to Rama)
--you, over there. Why are you here in the forest?

                RAMA
I have come to live in the jungle for 14 years with my brother, Lakshmana,
and wife,

                SURPANAKHA
Why?

                RAMA
Per my father's orders.

                SURPANAKHA
Why?

                RAMA
I was banished.

                SURPANAKHA
            (walking towards Sita)
You see?

     Mira flees, as does all her friends.

     Somehow, we feel uncomfortably close to what's happening.

                SURPANAKHA
            (back towards Rama)
Rama, that's it, right? You know my story. In fact, you know who I am
outside of my story too. You know how powerful I can be. I can create an
oasis for just us. No, envy, no curses, no family drama. Just peace. Let Fate
hold her breath, and come start the life we've always dreamed of!

     Sita looks dangerously at Rama.

                RAMA
            (sincerely)
If you are proposing I go off with you, I'm terribly sorry to say that will not
be possible. As I said earlier, I am married to my wife, Sita. However,
Lakshmana is still

     Sita's glare turns to giggles. She is reminded of why she loves
     Rama.

                LAKSHMANA
Yes, I am, but to marry me you'd have to be willing to serve my brother. Oh,
wait, let me be clear: not in bed on your knees, if that's what you're thinking.

     Now, both Sita and Rama are chuckling; Sita must have continued
     with Lakshmana's joke just between the

                SURPANAKHA
            (to Sita)
You think this is funny? Mocking me for the loss that I've suffered?

     After all the self-control she was able to keep up until this point,
     Surpanakha lunges at

                SURPANAKHA
You don't deserve him-! I do--

     Lakshmana brandishes his knife and slices Surpanakha's nose.

                SURPANAKHA
            (gasping)
Vidyutjihva-!

     Dark red blood bursts from her nose and down Surpanakha's
     beautiful

                SURPANAKHA
            (to Sita)
You...You'll regret this. You'll see. They're all the same.

     Surpanakha staggers off, her wedding robes stained with crimson
     blood.

                SITA
Even though she wanted more than pleasure... I guess people don't change
that much in the end. Did you see the way she looked at you?

                RAMA
            (serious)
Yes, even though I'm not quite sure why. She knows I'm marri--

     Sita kisses Rama. Lakshmana smiles while he cleans his dagger off.

     We suddenly are following YOUNG RAVANA as he inadvertently
     walks along Surpanakha's trail of blood. He is deep in various
     Vedic books while juggling instruments and a learnee's weapon. He
     wears the same clothes at the wedding. Occasionally, he tries a
     chant to Shiva. Men, humans and Gods alike, stare in disgust: a
     rakshasa--a demon!--trying to be

     As he ages, his clothes transform into those which show the
     physique and prowess of the ultimate Self-made Emperor. The
     wisps of his new nine heads shadows the movement of his most
     handsome one--their presence so translucent and transient, mere
     mortals have to look twice to see them. But when you do see their
     ghostly movement and illusive beauty, it is Ravana's charming--and
     consumingly powerful--aurora you

     We're now in the present, and the self-made Emperor enters his
     royal court room, still reading the Vedic book from when he was a
     child.


INTERIOR. RAVAN'A COURT ROOM

     RAVANA enters to a weeping SURPANAKHA. He stops dead in
     his tracks and finally notices all the blood on the floor. The trail
     leads to a larger pool which rests underneath his sister.

                RAVANA
It's been quite some time, Surpanakha. What is it? 10 years now?

     Murmuring.

                RAVANA
You've made quite the entrance. In front of all my ministers too. What
happened? I've tried to tell my people to leave you alone--

     Silence, as Surpanakha continues to wimper.

                RAVANA
            (to his ministers)
Leave us, please.

     Ravana walks over to Surpanakha's weeping form.

                RAVANA
Why did you come to me?

                SURPANAKHA
You're the only one who would understand. Even though I despise
everything that is Lanka, I have realized how foolish I have been.

     Ravana helps Surpanakha to his throne. She sits, he kneels.

                RAVANA
Tell me.

(The sentiments/dialogue below will eventually be translated to a duet.)

                SURPANAKHA
 You're right; we are not the same as them. Who am I to think I could escape
that simple fact? But that does not mean they are perfect, no, those
kyshatriyas think they can take everything. They take everything and leave us
nothing! God is on their side and what about us? What about you and me?
We are just pawns in their game of vanity. They who can tear the innocent
limb by limb, heart and

                RAVANA
Who has taken away your innocence?

                SURPANAKHA
I should have known. Long ago with Vidyutjihva, I should have acted! I
should of known that a rakshasa, no matter how faithful, could never be with
a

                RAVANA
But it wasn't him, was it? You met someone else.

                SURPANAKHA
Yes, I am ashamed to say I couldn't help it.

                RAVANA
It is not your fault, my sister. Passion is within our nature.

                SURPANAKHA
It was a woman.

                RAVANA
A woman?

                SURPANAKHA
A woman so...perfect. It is she who took away my innocence. Beautiful, witty,
her husband's equal. She holds the key, Ravana, to a perfect life. A life of
pure bliss: no violence or blemishes on her character. She is truly one with
the

                SURPANAKHA
Of course, she is married to the perfect kyshatriya, Rama, so radiant I
thought he was Vidyutjivha reincarnated. His brother is the one who did this
to me when I lost control and lunged for her: Sita, who doesn't have to try.

                RAVANA
Sita! The woman that rejected me to that godly man, Rama. How lucky he is
to have Fate on his side. Her beauty takes away everyone's innocence; no one
is as beauitful and pure as

     A breath.

                SURPANAKHA
I have realized my place in this world, and it is one where you and I must
level the playing field. Ravana, with all your knowledge in the vedas and
weaponry, it is time to use those for the greater good! To show the vain and
unworthy nature of the kshatriya!

                RAVANA
Come, it is time for us to receive our perfect life! After years of rejection--of
standing outside closed gates and unheard prayers--it is time for us to be
rewarded for our resilience. If the Gods are not going to help us, we will take
it for

                SURPANAKHA
Yes, the girl! Sita is the key to our freedom and to destroy the kyshatriya
name!

                RAVANA
Then it's settled! Let us go--

                SURPANAKHA
--to the Dandaka Forest! To the place I call home!

(End of Duet)

                                                     BLACKOUT


EXTERIOR. DANDAKA HUT.

     RAMA and LAKSHMANA are playing a friendly game of dice. It's
     early evening, and the sunset glows brightly on the hut.

                LAKSHMANA
You want to bet something even when we left Ayodhya with nothing in our
pockets? What are you going to

                RAMA
Not sure quite yet, but I'll think of something. Just to make things more
interesting, else what's the point in

                LAKSHMANA
Fair. I'll let you do the betting. I'll take whatever I can get.

                SITA
            (off-stage)
Boys, have you seen Mira? I was going to feed her, but she seemed to have
disappeared.

                RAMA
            (preoccupied)
No.

                LAKSHMANA
Rama, look!

     Lakshmana points to a deer in the distance.

                LAKSHMANA
Might that be Mira?

     Both princes look towards the deer. The sun is blinding.

                RAMA
Not sure. Maybe Sita would know?
            (to Sita O.S.)
Sita! I think we found Mira!

     Sita appears with a basket of fruit. Rama points towards the stoic
     deer. It is as if the deer is just as intrigued with them as they it.

                SITA
It is not Mira, but it's beautiful! Rama, can't you see?

                RAMA
No--

     Sita quickly ushers him to a spot where the sun doesn't blind the
     two.

                RAMA
Wow. Lakshmana, this is quite the deer.

                SITA
We should capture it! Mira would love a friend. We could name it Maya. Mira
and Maya...what a duo. I'm excited

                LAKSHMANA
            (on deaf ears)
Sita, I don't know. I've hunted many deer before, and this one... it irks me.

                SITA
Rama, would you capture it for me? I'm sure it would appreciate your many
stories... I mean, its looking right at

                RAMA
I don't know. It's been a while since I have hunted. If Lakshmana is uneasy,
that worries

                SITA
Fine. Then I will be sleeping outside with Mira while we wait for Maya to
appear again. Lakshmana can take my place next to you.

                LAKSHMANA
Sita, that's ridiculous--

                RAMA
Lakshmana, sit down.

     Lakshmana has turned around to see Rama sitting in front of the
     dice.

                LAKSHMANA
You can't be serious.

                RAMA
Sit down.

     Reluctantly, Lakshmana sits, bow in hand.

                RAMA
Only two dice. Doubles, we go after the deer.

                LAKSHMANA
I thought we decided not to go after the deer at all.

                RAMA
            (quietly to Lakshmana)
I know you might not believe me, but Sita has not asked for much these
entire thirteen years, and I think I owe her one. Plus, if it is something evil, I
will vanquish it. If not, Sita gets a friend. Either way, now...
            (jiggling dice)
...we don't have to make the decision.


                LAKSHMANA
Fine. Roll.

     Rama rolls the dice. Lakshmana holds his breath.

     Both look at the dice.

                RAMA
Snake eyes.
            (to Sita)
Sita, love, is the deer still there?

                SITA
Yes, and has made friends with Mira, just as I'd hoped!

     Just as Rama got up and grabbed his bow for the first time since
     they arrived at the Dandaka Hut, the deer sprints off. Rama runs
     after

                LAKSHMANA
Ok, since Rama's gone, you're under my care.

                SITA
I am fully capable of taking care of myself.

                LAKSHMANA
Well, I came to the forest for both of your safety.
            (sighs)
If it was Rama here, I would have said the same thing.

     An awkward silence.

                SITA
            (adjusting her garments)
Is that really why you came?

                LAKSHMANA
            (quick to defend)
Yes.

                SITA
It's...admirable.

                LAKSHMANA
I'm glad you think so.

                SITA
Rama needs a brother like you.

     Lakshmana smiles.

                SITA
Honestly, I don't know how you dealt with him when you both were younger.

                LAKSHMANA
We kept each other in line. I'd always make sure to support him whenever he
made a difficult decision. He has this habit of being... overly truthful. He can
never tell a lie. I personally don't understand it, but it has gotten him into
some serious emotional trouble. So, yes, I've come to 'protect' him.

                SITA
Tell me about it. It's as if he's the 'golden star' in his own drama. Title?
'Rama's

     Lakshmana bursts out laughing. The two continue to joke.

     Simultaneously, out of view from the Hut, we hear Rama's heavy
     breathing as he closes in on the illusive deer. It stops, yet right as he
     is about to draw back his bow, the deer stares into his soul.

     Rama forces himself to close his eyes, and only then does he
     release the

     The deer screeches.

     As Rama approaches the fallen deer, a woman can be heard
     gasping for air. Confused, Rama runs up to the unidentifiable
     woman.

                RAMA
            (to unknown woman)
What-!
            (towards Hut)
Sita! Lakshmana! Help me!
            (attempting to save the woman)
No, no,  stay with me. My brother Lakshmana will come to help us. He
always carries herbs with him, and Sita will bring water.

     As Rama is per-occupied with tending the wound, the woman
     suddenly brings Rama for a kiss but hesitates to close the gap.
     Rama realizes who it

                SURPANAKHA
I'm so sorry, Rama. Save her. Save her, please!

     Rama is stunned.

                SURPANAKHA
            (with deep sorrow)
No, no, you're already too late. It's too late!

                SITA
            (back at the hut)
You aren't just here for Rama!

     Sita and Lakshmana are in the middle of an argument. All we know
     is that it started when Rama called out Lakshmana's name.

                LAKSHMANA
            (in the doorway of the hut)
Sita, what are you talking about? I am here to protect you, now come inside
the hut with me,

                SITA
Rama needs you, why are you not going to help? So much for being there for
your

                LAKSHMANA
I know Rama better than anyone, and his shout was not one of pain. I need
to make sure you're safe before I go

                SITA
Safe? Safe and sound within your arms? You're an anarya--a disgrace--if you
think I'm going in there with you when Rama could be out there dying.

                LAKSHMANA
Sita--

                SITA
            (slight pause)
You've been waiting for this moment, haven't you? You and Kaikeyi
conspiring--

                LAKSHMANA
How dare you accuse me of such a deviant act! I may not be as 'perfect' as
Rama himself, but I have never lied to you. Ever. My duty is to protect you
just as much it is to protect Rama, and not once have I ever had such sinful
desires!

                SITA
Then prove it! Prove you're here to protect your brother, and not just to steal
the crown and

     Lakshmana grabs his weapons from the hut and darts off to find
     Rama. Sita sits quietly on the

     His heart; that's all Rama hears as he attempts to make his way
     back to the Hut. The sun is no longer above the horizon and
     suddenly Rama struggles to find his way

     As if circling the Hut, the princes run to find each other. The hut
     now the only place lit by the growing

     A gold ring falls from the sky in front of Rama's path. A lovebird,
     in the midst of mating, screams as his lover falls from the branch, a
     now bloody mess being struck by the ring. Rama freezes in horror
     as the bird mourns. Rama goes to pick up the bloody ring and
     immediately recognizes the engravings: It's Sita's.

                LAKSHMANA
Rama! There you are!

                RAMA
We've made a grave error.

                LAKSHMANA
What's wrong?

     Lakshmana follows Rama's gaze towards the sky.

                LAKSHMANA
Come, Sita is waiting for you.

                RAMA
Why did you leave her?

     Suddenly, Rama's wrathful gaze lands on Lakshmana.

                LAKSHMANA
She--she said I was conspiring with mother Kaikeyi to have you killed! She
accused me of lusting for her, and said to run after you to prove my dignity.

                RAMA
That is an incorrect answer, Lakshmana.

     Rama shows Lakshmana the ring.

                LAKSHMANA
Oh, God, what have we done?

     Both men run back towards the Hut to find it destroyed. Suddenly,
     the world begins to shrink in fear of Rama's wrath.

                RAMA
            (scrambling to find Sita and her
             things)
You... imbecile!

                LAKSHMANA
Me?! You're the one who thought it was a good idea to run after the deer in
the first

                RAMA
You had one job, Lakshmana! One. Job. How the hell could you screw me
over like this?

     Lakshmana is at a loss for words.

                RAMA
Don't just stand there, FIND HER!

                LAKSHMANA
            (Runs off to find Sita)
Sita! Maa Sita, I'm sorry! Please come back!

     We follow Rama as he peels over all the damage. It's clear someone
     has taken

     (Rama's Solo. Similar in spirit to "NO GOOD DEED". )

     Rama grabs his weapons; he swears he will destroy everything in
     his path until he finds Sita and proves to his Father above that he is
     still the princely kyshatriya Dasaratha has always seen in him.
     Ultimately, it's a song of deep pain.

     His last saving grace has been stolen.

                 INTERMISSION. END OF ACT 3.

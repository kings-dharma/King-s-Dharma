                           PROLOGUE


EXT. TAMSA RIVER - SPRING

     Valmiki wistfully sitting on the grass in front of the river. Vishnu
     stands next to him, his eagle Garuda sleeping on the ground.
     Both watch a male crane attempting to woo his female partner.
     Their songs are of

                VALMIKI
Holy one, is it possible for a man to possess all virtues of God himself?

                VISHNU
What qualities do you speak of?

                VALMIKI
Integrity, compassion, self-control, a flawless character.

                VISHNU
            (smirking)
Perhaps. There is one man who comes to mind. His story will make itself
known to you, and you must tell it. That is the only way it will become a
reality.

                VISHNU
            (preping Garuda)
But, never forget: however flawless, a man can suffer. Such is what it
means to be

     Vishnu and Gaurda fly off.

     Moments later, an arrow strikes the male crane. It cries out in
     pain, blood seeping into the pond. It's suddenly still. The female
     grieves at her loss, her song of great sorrow.

     (Begin opening number. It's grand, it's worldly.)

                VALMIKI
This atrocity-!

     Valmiki scrambles away, mortified.


EXT. VALMIKI'S HERMITAGE

     At sunset, a small hut sits in front of a pond where flowers
     blossom and animals find

                VALMIKI
Boys!

     Valmiki approaches his two twin male disciples who hold
     instruments. They are jamming

                VALMIKI
It is time I tell this story!

     Both boys stop and look at Valmiki, awaiting his first words.


EXT. VISHNU'S RIDE

     As Valmiki is detailing his story to the boys (unspoken),

     Vishnu rides Garuda.  We fly over a white and gold city. We fly
     through the markets, above the palace, and back towards the
     woods behind. All its residents are content. It's blissful peace.

     We follow them over a battlefield where golden kyshatriyas fight
     against the hardened Asuras. All different types of beings are
     present: Vanaras, Bears, Devas, and the like, as they support
     their respective

     We weave in and out of the skirmishes. It's a battle of the ages.

     Suddenly, we encounter a towering giant and a king Asura,
     flying in his own chariot. Vishnu swerves out of the way towards
     a couple

     A queen rides out to battle, her husband laying injured a ways
     out. We follow her as she fights for a clear path towards her
     lover.

     She helps him up into the chariot. They kiss, finally reunited.

     Vishnu and Garuda leave back towards the Heavens.

                                         CONTINUED INTO ACT 1

1EXT. VALMIKI'S HERMITAGE- CONTINUING FROM PROLOGUE                            1

     Valmiki tells about Dasaratha, how he wooed Kaikeyi, and how
     after the War, Dasaratha became King, Kaikeyi lead Queen. Luv
     and Kush continue their playing and harmonize Valmiki.

     Ghostly figures appear on stage and surround the trio, reenacting
     the story. It's elegant, mythical, and reminds us of shadow
     puppetry.

                VALMIKI
            (spoken interlude)
And so, he gave each of his Queens the nectar of the Gods in hopes to
produce an heir. But, one Queen got more than the rest, and queen Kaikeyi
would never forget that

     DASARATHA is seen giving a larger portion to KAUSALYA
     while KAIKEYI

     Simultaneously, we see JANAKA working his own fields. He
     sees BABY SITA buried in a furrow. Valmiki sings about how
     Janaka was awaiting a daughter--a daughter that would remind
     him of his deceased

     BABY RAMA is born, and everyone's attention is on him and
     Kausalya. The rest of THE BOYS are born shortly after, but the
     King's attention is no longer on

     Suddenly, a young princess SITA takes center stage. Living
     around all women, she's excited to find a man.

     Dasaratha's four young boys enter the palace; the three follow
     RAMA, a prince of Sita's age.

Father! Father! You called?

                JANAKA
Happy birthday, my dear! Sixteen, is it now?

                SITA
What did you get me?

                JANAKA
            (reaching into his pocket)
Hmm, I think I know...

                JANAKA
Ah-hah!

     Janaka pulls out a ring. It's his Wife's.

                SITA
What is it?

                JANAKA
It's your Step-Mother's. It was the ring I gave her when we first met.

     Sita takes the ring. It is as radiant as the sun.

                SITA
Does that mean...

                JANAKA
Yes, it is time for you to wed.

                SITA
Oh, Father!

                JANAKA
And, just like your Step-Mother, you shall get to choose your husband.

                VISWAMITRA
My Lord, the boy is sixteen. You must let Fate take its course.

                DASARATHA
He is my son, revered Viswamitra, he is still a child! How can we be
certain that he will be safe with you? Rakshasas are unforgiving!

                VISWAMITRA
He is destined to fight demons. He is not an ordinary child, Dasaratha!

                DASARATHA
            (defeated)
You are right. I must learn to control my attachment for the greater good
of my

     Rama and Lakshmana enter.

                DASARATHA
Rama, my son, Viswamitra needs a kyshatriya's prowess to kill some
demons that have been terrorizing the sages. You must go with him.

                RAMA
Yes, Father.

                LAKSHMANA
            (grabbing Rama)
What about me? You can't take Rama without me!

                VISWAMITRA
Yes, you may join your brother.

     The boys leave with Viswamitra. Dasaratha holds his breath.

     Teen Surpanakha and Ravana race through the Lanka Markets.
     Vibhishana is trying to catch them. Both hold sticks as swords,
     swiping the enemies that are the stall vendors.

                RAVANA

One of these days, you will bow down to me! Even the Devas will bow
down to

   I'M GONNA BE A MIGHTY KING,
   SO ENEMIES BEWARE.

                VIBHISHANA
   WELL I'VE NEVER SEEN A KING OR DEVA
   WITH SUCH A DEMON'S GLARE.

                RAVANA
   I'M GONNA BE THE MAIN EVENT,
   LIKE NO KING WAS BEFORE.
   THE DEVAS WILL BE LOOKING DOWN,
   WHEN THEY HEAR MY BATTLE HORN.

                VIBHISHANA
   THUS FAR, A RATHER HOPELESS SIBLING.

                RAVANA
   OH, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING!

   YOU HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IF YOU WANT A CHANCE--

     Ravana and Surpanakha are running through the halls.

                VIBHISHANA
   I THINK IT'S TIME THAT YOU AND I
   ARRANGED A HEART TO HEART.

                RAVANA

   FROM RED-FACED BROTHERS FOR A START.

   OUT OF SERVICE, OUT OF LANKA

   OH, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING!

     A messenger brings Ravana a note.

                RAVANA
A princess in Mithila is hosting a swayumvara. My future Queen!

                VIBHISHANA
            (on deaf ears)
Brother, I do not think the stars have it in for you. She's a warrior's
princess!

Let's go!

10EXT. MITHILA COURTYARD                                                      10

     Princely Suitors line up to try and string Shiva's bow. Among
     them, Vibhishana, Ravana and Surpanakha are the only demons
     there.

                VIBHISHANA
I would advise just watching. That bow is of Godly power. I can just feel
it.

                RAVANA
I don't care what other people think. If I want to try and string that bow,
then I will. Who knows? Maybe I'll get

                SURPANAKHA
            (flirting from afar with
             Vidyutjihva)
Ravana, please string that bow. Then I may have one of the handsome
suitors

                JANAKA
Sita, have you chosen yet?

                SITA
No. They're all the same. They flex their muscles, lick their lips, and hide
after they can't move the bow an

                JANAKA
Do not fret. We will find someone eventually.

                GUARD
Next-!

                SURPANAKHA
Good luck, King Ravana!

     Rama, Lakshmana and Viswamitra enter. Rama's gaze
     immediately goes towards Ravana as he approaches the
     legendary

     Once on the podium, Ravana considers casting a spell but
     hesitates.

                RAVANA
Play fair. That's the right way.

     Ravana attempts to lift the bow; he has gotten the farthest out of
     all the suitors before him. His gaze lands on Sita and her beauty.

     Ravana loses his grip and falls over. A mocking outburst can be
     heard from the crowds. He shrinks back to Vibhishana and
     Surpanakha.

                JANAKA
Good grief. They cannot seem to take their eyes off you, can they?

                GUARD
Next-!

                VISWAMITRA
            (to Rama)
My boy, you must go up and string that bow. Only then can you prove
worthy of your future

                LAKSHMANA
That bow is huge! Brother, if you can lift that, you can conquer anything!

                LAKSHMANA
            (to his mesmerized brother)
Rama?

                RAMA
Oh-- yes, sir.

     Rama slowly approaches podium.

                JANAKA
Ah, there is one more.

     Sita looks at Rama. Their gaze has not yet met, but Sita knows.

                SITA
This will be the one.

                JANAKA
What? He looks so young.

                SITA
Just watch, Father.

     Rama hovers his hands above the bow. The power radiating off
     the bow is visible; as Rama's hand gets closer, the power
     intensifies. The heavenly bow snaps itself into Rama's hand.

     As if the bow was made of feathers, Rama lifts the bow upright.
     But the minute he places the bow on the floor to string it, the
     bottom stabs a crack in the Earth, the crack running the length of
     the

     With the bow sticking upright in the ground, Rama attempts to
     string it. As the bow bends to a full crescent, it snaps. A
     shockwave radiates through everything and everyone.

     Barsi' by Band Baaja

                SITA
            (excitedly getting up)
Yes, he's the one!

     While everyone congratulates Sita for finding a husband, Rama
     desparately tries to recover the broken bow. Sita comes up from
     behind him holding a handful of blue lotuses and water lilies.
     She taps him on the shoulders. Rama turns around and
     immediately blushes at her

     Sita hands him the flowers and gives him a kiss. It's as if two
     ancient lovers have

Would you do me the honor of being my prince?

                RAMA
Yes, I would love that.

                SURPANAKHA
He did it. He broke the bow of the Devas. It's as if he is one himself, don't
you

                RAVANA
Yeah, he broke it effortlessly.

     Officer Rama, now in his twenties, sits at his plain desk
     reviewing proposals for a new set of laws. Besides his scrolls
     and a quill, bright lotuses float in a vase.

                SITA
Ah, there he is!

                RAMA
Hello, my love, how can I help? I am quite busy reading these
amendments. They need to be passed as soon as possible. The word on the
street is that domestic violence has become more of a problem, and we
currently do not have any robust standards in place.

Clever, clever. Have you gotten to mine yet?

You wrote one?

                SITA
Yes, but don't tell anybody.

            (shuffling through the scrolls)
Is it under your name?

     Sita goes to lean up against the back of his desk, and pushes
     aside the

                SITA
Of course not. I'm not telling you which one it is, either. Come, let's go for
a walk. You've been in here all week. I miss being with you.

                SITA
We can find those favorite flowers of yours.

                RAMA
You mean, the lotuses you stuffed my face in during your swayumvara?

                SITA
            (reaching for the flowers in the
             vase)
If I do it again will you come?

     Rama stands up and turns Sita's face for a kiss. He takes her
     hands in

                RAMA
I don't need those, my flower.

                SITA
That's the right attitude!

     Hand in hand, Sita swiftly leads Rama out of his office, his
     scrolls hitting the floor. On the way, they pass Manthara walking

                MANTHARA
Ugh, you should see those two.

                KAIKEYI
Who?

                MANTHARA
That half-son of yours. The one always fawning over Sita.

                KAIKEYI
Manthara, please save it. I am trying to be in a good mood for dinner
tonight.

                MANTHARA
The one where Queen Kausalya will be in between you and King
Dasaratha?

                KAIKEYI
Yes, but that is not an excuse to be unaproachable.

                MANTHARA
The head queen should sit beside her king, not next to one of her
mistresses. Don't you think it's a bit

                KAIKEYI
What?

                MANTHARA
That he prefers Queen Kausalya over you, and her son will be king? The
son who goes on romantic romps instead of tending to princely duties,
while Prince Bharata is deep in literature and study. This was always the
case, even when they were children: Princes Rama and Lakshmana would
be goofing off with the sages, while Prince Bharata was left studying
politics with your minster

                KAIKEYI
What are you implying this time Manthara? You're so melodramatic...

                MANTHARA
Prince Bharata should be king, my lady, and you know it.

                KAIKEYI
We've had this conversation before. I don't understand why you keep
bringing it up. Dasaratha sees us all

                MANTHARA
Lately, I just feel King Dasaratha has been forgetful of you.

                KAIKEYI
He still spends nights with me. I haven't noticed anything out of the
ordinary.

                MANTHARA
A whole three nights a week compared to when he was madly in love with
you. Remember when you both were young, and you saved him in battle?
Don't you think you deserve more of his attention?

     Silence.

                MANTHARA
Dasaratha has forgotten his love for you because he's been blinded by his
love for Prince Rama, a son by an inferior queen! My queen, you should
have been the mother of the eldest, not Kausalya! Your son should be
king!

                KAIKEYI
What should I do?

                MANTHARA
After all these years and all the kings that I have served, I have never seen
a queen so powerful as yourself, Kaikeyi. Use your boons.

                KAIKEYI
Those were--I didn't need to be bribed by boons to save his life in battle.
He gave them to me as a courtesy, a way to say 'I love you.'

                MANTHARA
What love? He offered them, so use them. If he loves you, he will hold his
word. Ask for Rama to be banished for fourteen years in the forest. That
way, it will give enough time to demonstrate Prince Bharata's ability to be
king, and you will become the head Queen

                KAIKEYI
It is my night with Dasaratha. I will confront him about it later. For now,
tell the King I am feeling unwell, and will not be there for dinner. I must
think about what you've

     Manthara exits. Kaikeyi finishes putting on her jewelry.

     (Begin Kaikeyi's solo. She is undecided. She reminisces about
     the war, their deep love for each other, and how she misses those
     days. She ends up envying Rama and Sita, as they resemble what
     she's

     Eventually, Kaikeyi decides to put on one of her scantily outfits
     to prepare for when Dasaratha comes to bed. She throws pedals
     on the floor and lights her candles. She knows exactly what she's
     doing.)


INT. KAIKEYI'S ROOM - NIGHT

                DASARATHA
Kaikeyi, my Queen, is everything alright?

     Dasaratha enters to a scantily dressed Kaikeyi lying in bed.

                DASARATHA
I thought you were unwell.

                KAIKEYI
            (unnervingly sexy)
After some time to myself, I seem to be fine, especially now that you've
walked

                DASARATHA
Is it our anniversary already?

                KAIKEYI
            (pulling Dasaratha to bed)
No, but let's make up for all the nights left uncelebrated.

                DASARATHA
I'm--This is not the best time, Kaikeyi.

     Kaikeyi begins to talk off the King's robes.

                KAIKEYI
With you, it's never the best time. I've known you long enough to know
that.

                DASARATHA
No, this is really not a good time. Has Manthara not told you? I sent her to
your chambers today to spread the

                KAIKEYI
What?

                DASARATHA
My ministers and I have made the decision today to have Rama crowned
yuvaraja, and we begin planning his coronation early tomorrow morning.

                KAIKEYI
She--

                DASARATHA
            (leading Kaikeyi over to her
             window)
My queen, I've seen bad omens. Just look at the stillness of the trees and
feel the heaviness of the air. It was time to choose an successor, and
quickly. I fear my time on this Earth is nearing an end.

     Kaikeyi abruptly kisses Dasaratha, leading him back to the bed.

                KAIKEYI
            (undressing)
Let's finish what we started then, while we have the time.

     Dasaratha, now interested, follows Kaikeyi's passion.

                KAIKEYI
Listen to me, Dasaratha, you will do exactly what I say.

                DASARATHA
Of course, my love. What will it be tonight?

                KAIKEYI
            (whispering in his ear)
You must give me my two boons.

                DASARATHA
This is our time together. Hide nothing from me.

                KAIKEYI
One, you must make Bharata king.

                DASARATHA
What--

                KAIKEYI
Two, you must banish Rama for fourteen years to the Dandaka vana.

                DASARATHA
            (jumping out of bed)
You snake!

                KAIKEYI
You gave me your word! All those years ago, when we were in love, like
we are now, you said I could have two

                DASARATHA
Please, for all that is worthy of your boons, why banish our beloved
Rama?

                KAIKEYI
Do it, Dasaratha! Uphold your dharma as king; don't rescind your word
and be a blot on the Ishvaku Dynasty. Don't bring misfortune to your
children. Don't bring a curse on

                DASARATHA
You're insane.

                RAMA (O.S.)
Father! Mother!

     Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita appear at the doorway of Kaikeyi's
     chambers. Both adults slip on their

                RAMA
How can we be of help? Manthara said Mother was ill.

     The three notice their parents: disheveled, blushing, and sheets
     strewn on the

                RAMA
I'm sorry, we must have been mistaken.

                KAIKEYI
No, perfect timing. I was just helping your father peel through a rough
decision, but it's something he is still struggling to admit.

                RAMA
What is it? I may be able to provide guidance. Or, Bharata! Bharata would
also give great

     Kaikeyi glares at Dasaratha to respond.

                KAIKEYI
When your father was a young kyshatriya like yourself, he gave me two
boons for saving his life. However, he now has chosen the path of
selfishness unless you, my Rama, agree to fulfill those boons for him.

                DASARATHA
Son, you do not have to listen to her. I will not be king much longer, and I
would rather you focus on becoming the yuvaraja than listen to her petty
request. Did Manthara not say Rama has been chosen to be my heir-


                LAKSHMANA
What?!

                SITA
No.

     Everyone looks to Rama. Dasaratha begins weeping.

                RAMA
Mother, what are your boons?

                KAIKEYI
Rama, you will be banished for fourteen years in the Dandaka vana.
Lakshmana will join you. Bharata will be crowned yuvaraja in your place.

                LAKSHMANA
This is unacceptable! Rama is the rightful heir to the throne. Bharata will
agree!

                RAMA
Done. I just wish you would have been more thoughtful about Father.

     Rama leads Dasaratha to the open window.

     ('Their Sign' sung by Jonathan Raviv & Company in The
     Lightning Thief. Modified lyrics and Song will not be in the
     final

                RAMA
It will be alright.

                DASARATHA
Just look towards the heavens, son. I knew something was awry.

                RAMA
If I'm going to be king, I must uphold your standard--the same standards
that have given such splendor to your people. That is a king's dharma, and
therefore

                RAMA
You musn't blame yourself.

                LAKSHMANA
Then what is this all for?

                RAMA
I'm afriad there are some questions only the Devas themselves can answer.
We must look for a

                RAMA
   WE HAVE TO BE PATIENT,
   A SIGN THAT THE DEVAS HAVE A PLAN.
   
   I KONW THE FUTURE LOOKS BLURRY,
   BUT, NOT TO WORRY, WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN.
   
   YES, THE DEVAS ARE VERY REAL,
   THOUGH THEY OFTEN WON'T REVEAL,
   WHY WE'RE HERE, WHAT THEY WANT, THEIR DESIGN.
            (to Dasaratha)
   HAVE FAITH, KEEP YOUR CHIN UP,
   WE'LL HAVE TO ADJUST,
   AND TRUST WE'LL SEE THEIR SIGN.

                LAKSHMANA
So if the Devas have a plan for us, I'd like to know what it is. They have a
lot to answer
   
   THEY SHOW NO MERCY TO THOSE ALL AROUND US,
   NO SIGN THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY CARE
   
   WE WERE BORN TO RUN FATHER'S KINGDOM
   THAT'S WHO WE ARE
   ELSE, NO ONE WOULD BE THERE
   
   WHY CAN'T MY BROTHER, WHO DESERVES THE BEST
   BE OUR KING WITHOUT PROTEST
   DON'T MEAN TO WHIMPER OR WHINE
   
   DEVAS, IF YOU'RE THERE, WE'RE ALL WAITING HERE,
   PLEASE, GIVE US SOME SORT OF SIGN.
   
So? Explain yourselves!

     Orchestration continues.

                SITA
It could be... well, I don't want to pretend I know what the Devas are
thinking.

                RAMA
That's probably for the best.
            (to Dasaratha)
Come, Father, let's find somehwere for you to rest.

     Rama and Dasaratha leave.

                SITA
            (to Lakshmana)
But, I have some theories.

                LAKSHMANA
Like what?

                SITA
I don't think Rama really knows what's going on. You were there during
my swayumvara, he's not like you or

                LAKSHMANA
What are you saying?

                SITA
Signs are not always some golden object or even a prophecy itself. Maybe,
it comes in the form of the people that you meet in this life.
   HE'S A SIGN THAT THE DEVAS HAVE THOUGHT THROUGH
   THE FUTURE, THAT'S WHY HE'S HERE.

                LAKSHMANA
And if he isn't?

                SITA
   THEN NOBODY CAN BLAME YOU,
   FOR HOLDING A GRUDGE,
   AGAINST WHAT SEEMS UNFAIR.
   

                LAKSHMANA
Wait, so you think Rama is divine?

                SITA
Maybe!

                LAKSHMANA
And the Devas sent him here for some purpose? Why couldn't they just
come on their

                SITA
I don't know, I'm not one of them! But,
   WHEN THE DEVAS ARE DISTANT,
   OR SEEM NON-EXISTENT,
   HANG ON, CAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.
   
   I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO BE THINKING ALOUD:

                LAKSHMANA
   RAMA, A DEVA JUST WALKING ABOUT!
   A MAN WE'VE LIVED WITH FOR OUR ENTIRE LIVES NOW,

                SITA / LAKSHMANA
   IS OF A DEVA'S DESIGN!

                          END ACT 2.

                            ACT 3


15EXT. DANDAKA HUT - 13 YEARS LATER.                                          15

     RAMA and SITA sit outside of the Dandaka Hut. It's peaceful,
     as every early morning

     Sita is matting and combing Rama's wet tangled hair. It clearly
     hurts, as Sita pines her fingers unceremoniously through his
     knots.

     LAKSHMANA comes out of the Dandaka Hut holding
     makeshift tools, hair also wet, but neatly done up in a matted
     bun.

                LAKSHMANA
That should be it. No more wobbly deck. I just forgot to secure--

     Rama excitedly hugs Lakshmana, forcing Sita to forego the
     current

                RAMA
It's perfect. You did a great job.

                LAKSHMANA
Are you hungry or something? You can't even see it--

                SITA
No, Rama's just a wimp and doesn't want me to finish his hair.

                RAMA
We have all day to finish my hair.
            (returning to Sita)
Especially since I've have a story to tell you, my love.

                SITA
Let me guess, it's a word-for-word retelling of "Vyasa's" apocalyptic
future. Yeah, I think we've heard that one enough times. The Sages'
favorite--
            (After second thought)
Pretty sure you're in it too....Wait....

                RAMA
Ha-ha, no, not that one. That one's too long to tell in one sitting which is
why the Sages had to tell us bits and pieces here and there. No, this one I
just dreamed of last night. Thought you might like it, and maybe
Lakshmana might

                SITA
Does that mean there's violence?

                RAMA
I promise to keep the violence to the minimum.

                SITA
You better. That's the whole point; remember when we lived with the
Sages? No violence, especially coming from you. If so, you'll scare away
Mira.

     The gold deer walks shyly up to Sita. She whispers quietly to it
     which coaxes the deer to lie down with its head in her lap.

                LAKSHMANA
Holler when you get to the spicy parts. I'm going to find food.

     Lakshmana collects his bow and arrows.

                SITA
Don't hunt Mira's friends!

                LAKSHMANA
            (on his way out of sight)
Not everyone can speak to animals, Sita!

                RAMA
Are you ready?

                SITA
Let's hear what you've got.

                RAMA
            (Sitting close to Sita, also stroking
             Mira's
One day, there was a women like yourself: radiant, youthful, hopeful...in
love. It was if she had the world ahead of her--like you do--but for one
small difference: she was born in a demonic world--a world of vanity and
selfishness.

     (Begin orchestration)

     Suddenly, a familiar golden city surrounds the couple, except
     that it's somehow even more Godly. A young SURPANAKHA is
     shoved out of a glistening marble home, crying. Cry elsewhere!

     She roams the streets and cautiously attempts to distance herself
     from the drunk, half-naked PEDESTRIANS. From the cracked-
     -open golden doors, raunchy party-goers could be heard.

                RAMA
This world attracted those who wanted to enjoy only the pleasures in life.
Finding herself stuck in this fake reality, the princess fled north, eventually
settling herself in the forest. As fate would have it, she ran into a Danavan
prince named

     In Rama and Sita's place are now VIDYUTJIHVA and
     SURPANAKHA. We are now in the distant past. It's neither
     night or day. Vidyutjihva and Surpanakha are cuddling, both a
     disheveled

                VIDYUTJIHVA
Come again? Your brother is a king? How come you have never
mentioned this to me

                SURPANAKHA
He wouldn't have been able to attend the swayumvara if he wansn't an
heir-apparent.

                VIDYUTJIHVA
I suppose I was too busy looking at you to notice.

                SURPANAKHA
Well, he definitely was too busy looking at that princess. Marrying her
would have made our lives a whole lot easier. Instead, I was forced to hold
my own. He's constantly looking for his next big chance at power, so he
gets lost up
            (points to her forehead)
--too often which is why I left.

                VIDYUTJIHVA
Yes, you definitely can hold your own, that's for sure. Somehow, you
always manage to find me when I'm lost though, which is quite often and
for long periods of time

                SURPANAKHA
Yes, the forests are not kind to those who do not call them home.

                VIDYUTJIHVA
At this point, maybe I should. I also am not wanted back home. Not until I
prove that I am not a waste of space. That's what happens when you have
three other brothers who are all better in every way, you know? Maybe I
should move to the forest with you. I know I'm not a--

     (Song in the spirit of 'Only Us' performed by Laura Dreyfuss in
     Dear Evan

     Surpanakha doesn't care that Vidyutjihva is of a different race.
     Rather, he spends the time to

     Similarly, Vidyutjihva is grateful for Surpanakaha's
     companionship. She doesn't care if he is a pitiful warrior.

     Surpanakha and Vidyutjihva decide that it would be better to be
     alone in the forest, just the two of them, than to face the reality
     of what the world asks them to

                SURPANAKHA
            (half-haphazardly putting on her
             gowns)
Let's go.

                VIDYUTJIHVA
Go where?

                SURPANAKHA
Get up, get up! We're going to make this place your home.

                SITA
            (elsewhere)
Rama, you better not be hinting at something.

                RAMA
            (elsewhere)
What?

                SITA
We are only going to be here for another year. Right?

                RAMA
Oh! Yes. This is...No! No, this is not a story about us. Yes, we will only be
here another

                SITA
We'll see...

                RAMA
Eventually, Surpanakha and Vidyutjihva make it back to the demon world.
For Surpanakha, this would be her first time back since she fled.

     With Rama's narrative: Hand-in-hand, Surpanakha and
     Vidyutjihva approach RAVANA. Both wearing their most
     elegant gowns. Surpanakha introduces Vidyutjihva.

                RAMA
Noticing love in her eyes, the King smiled and decided to wed the two.
The princess has finally discovered the pleasure in love. However, as the
King turned his

     Vidyutjihva lunges at Ravana with a knife. We're suddenly in
     Ravana's great hall, where all of SURPANAKHA'S FAMILY can
     be seen attending the wedding ceremony. The knife nicks
     Ravana in the back. Ravana reflexively brandishes his sword and
     slices Vidyutjihva's head off. Surpanakha screams, and lunges
     for Vidyutjihva, landing right on top of his severed head.

     Ravana notices the pendant around Surpanakha's neck. It has a
     Danavan

                RAVANA
            (to Surpanakha)
You are a traitor.

     Surpanakha continues to weep as the head turns to ash.

                RAVANA
And here in the world of pleasure, we have no room for tears.

     Surpanakha's family jeers.

     We're back at the peaceful Danka Hut. Mira has resorted to
     sleeping on the grass. Rama places his head on Sita's lap.

                RAMA
After being subjugated to such humiliation, Surpanakha again fled the
Demon

                SITA
She didn't deserve to be treated that way.

                RAMA
True. Sometimes fate can be cruel, but only Time will tell. The best thing
we can do is act according to what is

                SITA
            (Speculatively)
Whose to say what's right?

                RAMA
The Sages, our fathers and mothers, our friends... they deserve our utmost
respect. Enacting such respect is the right thing to do. That is what's right.

                SITA
Continue your story.

                RAMA
Why? It only gets uglier.

                SITA
So we don't end up talking in circles about dharma.

                RAMA
Alright...

     Surpanakha has reached the Dandaka Hut still in her beautiful
     garments. She notices Rama and Sita giggling among
     themselves.

                RAMA
I better get Lakshmana. This is the saucy part!
            (gets up and looks for Lakshmana)
Lakshmana! This will be your favorite part!

                SITA
We finally got there! For once, we've gotten almost to the end!

     Rama nudges Sita jokingly.

     Lakshmana appears from behind the hut carrying a basket of
     berries and other fresh food. He sets it down in front of the
     couple. Rama gingerly opens the basket and immediately begins
     to

     Lakshmana glances over to Sita and smirks.

                LAKSHMANA
You're lucky I was close. Okay, get on with it.

                RAMA
Where was I? Oh! Right. The demon princess fled, for the second time.
Except this time, she was looking for another man--

                SURPANAKHA
            (coming out of the bushes)
Yes, I am!

                RAMA
--to please her.

     The three turn around and stare at Surpanakha, dressed to the
     nines in, what humans would consider, scandalous--yet
     exceptionally elegant--robes. By her behavior, she is clearly
     done trying to make good first-impressions.

                SURPANAKHA
            (sees Rama)
...Vidyutjihva?

                RAMA
It's Rama. Nice to meet you.

                RAMA
            (in disbelief)
Who are you?

                SURPANAKHA
You know who I am.

                LAKSHMANA
Your name.

                SURPANAKHA
Surpanakha. Wif--Ex-wife of Vidyutjihva. The fomer exiled prince of this
forest.

                SITA
...and you think he's here?

                SURPANAKHA
            (lustfully)
If I pretend hard enough.

     Lakshmana steps in between Rama and Surpanakha to try and
     ease the tension. With Lakshmana's naturally large stance, it only
     makes it

                SURPANAKHA
            (to Sita)
No wonder why Vidyutjihva didn't actually love me. He likes a different
type of

                SITA
Rama is not Vidyutjihva.

                SURPANAKHA
He looks quite alike per my memory. Same physique, same beautiful eyes.
Say,
            (pointing to Rama)
--you, over there. Why are you here in the forest?

                RAMA
I have come to live in the jungle for 14 years with my brother, Lakshmana,
and wife,

                SURPANAKHA
Why?

                RAMA
Per my father's orders.

                SURPANAKHA
Why?

                RAMA
I was banished.

                SURPANAKHA
            (walking towards Sita)
You see?

     Mira flees, as does all her friends.

     Somehow, we feel uncomfortably close to what's happening.

                SURPANAKHA
            (back towards Rama)
Rama, that's it, right? You know my story. In fact, you know who I am
outside of my story too. You know how powerful I can be. I can create an
oasis for just us. No, envy, no curses, no family drama. Just peace. Let
Fate hold her breath, and come start the life we've always dreamed of!

     Sita looks dangerously at Rama.

                RAMA
            (sincerely)
If you are proposing I go off with you, I'm terribly sorry to say that will
not be possible. As I said earlier, I am married to my wife, Sita. However,
Lakshmana is still

     Sita's glare turns to giggles. She is reminded of why she loves
     Rama.

                LAKSHMANA
Yes, I am, but to marry me you'd have to be willing to serve my brother.
Oh, wait, let me be clear: not in bed on your knees, if that's what you're
thinking.

     Now, both Sita and Rama are chuckling; Sita must have
     continued with Lakshmana's joke just between the two.

                SURPANAKHA
            (to Sita)
You think this is funny? Mocking me for the loss that I've suffered?

     After all the self-control she was able to keep up until this point,
     Surpanakha lunges at

                SURPANAKHA
You don't deserve him-! I do--

     Lakshmana brandishes his knife and slices Surpanakha's nose.

                SURPANAKHA
            (gasping)
Vidyutjihva-!

     Dark red blood bursts from her nose and down Surpanakha's
     beautiful

                SURPANAKHA
            (to Sita)
You...You'll regret this. You'll see. They're all the same.

     Surpanakha staggers off, her wedding robes stained with crimson
     blood.

                SITA
Even though she wanted more than pleasure... I guess people don't change
that much in the end. Did you see the way she looked at you?

                RAMA
            (serious)
Yes, even though I'm not quite sure why. She knows I'm marri--

     Sita kisses Rama. Lakshmana smiles while he cleans his dagger
     off.

     We suddenly are following RAVANA as he inadvertently walks
     along Surpanakha's trail of blood. He is deep in various Vedic
     books while juggling instruments and a learnee's weapon. He
     wears the same clothes at the wedding. Occasionally, he tries a
     chant to Shiva. Men, humans and Gods alike, stare in disgust: a
     rakshasa--a demon!--trying to be

     As he ages, his clothes transform into those which show the
     physique and prowess of the ultimate Self-made Emperor. The
     wisps of his new nine heads shadows the movement of his most
     handsome one--their presence so translucent and transient, mere
     mortals have to look twice to see them. But when you do see
     their ghostly movement and illusive beauty, it is Ravana's
     charming--and consumingly powerful--aurora you feel.

     We're now in the present, and the self-made Emperor enters his
     royal court room, still reading the Vedic book from when he was
     a


16INTERIOR. RAVAN'A COURT ROOM                                                16

     RAVANA enters to a weeping SURPANAKHA. He stops dead in
     his tracks and finally notices all the blood on the floor. The trail
     leads to a larger pool which rests underneath his sister.

                RAVANA
It's been quite some time, Surpanakha. What is it? 10 years now?

     Murmuring.

                RAVANA
You've made quite the entrance. In front of all my ministers too. What
happened? I've tried to tell my people to leave you alone--

     Silence, as Surpanakha continues to wimper.

                RAVANA
            (to his ministers)
Leave us, please.

     Ravana walks over to Surpanakha's weeping form.

                RAVANA
Why did you come to me?

                SURPANAKHA
You're the only one who would understand. Even though I despise
everything that is Lanka, I have realized how foolish I have been.

     Ravana helps Surpanakha to his throne. She sits, he kneels.

                RAVANA
Tell me.

(The sentiments/dialogue below will eventually be translated to a duet.)

                SURPANAKHA
 You're right; we are not the same as them. Who am I to think I could
escape that simple fact? But that does not mean they are perfect, no, those
kyshatriyas think they can take everything. They take everything and leave
us nothing! God is on their side and what about us? What about you and
me? We are just pawns in their game of vanity. They who can tear the
innocent limb by limb, heart and

                RAVANA
Who has taken away your innocence?

                SURPANAKHA
I should have known. Long ago with Vidyutjihva, I should have acted! I
should of known that a rakshasa, no matter how faithful, could never be
with a

                RAVANA
But it wasn't him, was it? You met someone else.

                SURPANAKHA
Yes, I am ashamed to say I couldn't help it.

                RAVANA
It is not your fault, my sister. Passion is within our nature.

                SURPANAKHA
It was a woman.

                RAVANA
A woman?

                SURPANAKHA
A woman so...perfect. It is she who took away my innocence. Beautiful,
witty, her husband's equal. She holds the key, Ravana, to a perfect life. A
life of pure bliss: no violence or blemishes on her character. She is truly
one with

                SURPANAKHA
Of course, she is married to the perfect kyshatriya, Rama, so radiant I
thought he was Vidyutjivha reincarnated. His brother is the one who did
this to me when I lost control and lunged for her: Sita, who doesn't have to
try.

                RAVANA
Sita! The woman who I suffered humiliation for. I remember her
swayumvara like it was yesterday. Somehow, in that moment, she
convinced me to refrain from using a mantra: to be like an ordinary Man,
even though I have become more powerful than the Devas themselves!
But, that insufferable prince held nothing back, bending the bow to his
every will. He didn't even touch it. He didn't even have to think. Neither
did she in picking him. That day still haunts me; after all I have worked
and sufferd for, I should have a princess like her.
            (wistfully)
Sita, whose beauty takes away everyone's innocence; no one is as beauitful
and pure as

                SURPANAKHA
I have realized my place in this world, and it is one where you and I must
level the playing field. Brother, with all your knowledge in the vedas and
weaponry, it is time to use those for the greater good! To show the vain
and unworthy nature of the kshatriya!

                RAVANA
Come, it is time for us to receive our perfect life! After years of rejection--
-of standing outside closed gates and unheard prayers--it is time for us to
be rewarded! If God is not going to help us, we will take it for ourselves!
Sita will be

                SURPANAKHA
Yes, the girl! Sita is the key to our freedom and to destroy the kyshatriya
name!

                RAVANA
Then it's settled! Let us go--

                SURPANAKHA
--to the Dandaka Forest! To the place I call home!

(End of Duet)

                                                     BLACKOUT


17EXTERIOR. DANDAKA HUT.                                                      17

     RAMA and LAKSHMANA are playing a friendly game of dice.
     It's early evening, and the sunset glows brightly on the hut.

                LAKSHMANA
You want to bet something even when we left Ayodhya with nothing in
our pockets? What are you going to

                RAMA
Not sure quite yet, but I'll think of something just to make things more
interesting, else what's the point in

                LAKSHMANA
Fair. I'll let you do the betting. I'll take whatever I can get.

                SITA (O.S.)
Boys, have you seen Mira? I was going to feed her, but she seemed to
have

                RAMA
            (preoccupied)
No.

                LAKSHMANA
Rama, look!

     Lakshmana points to a deer in the distance.

                LAKSHMANA
Might that be Mira?

     Both princes look towards the deer. The sun is blinding.

                RAMA
Not sure. Maybe Sita would know?
            (to Sita O.S.)
Sita! I think we found Mira!

     Sita appears with a basket of fruit. Rama points towards the stoic
     deer. It is as if the deer is just as intrigued with them as they it.

                SITA
It is not Mira, but it's beautiful! Rama, can't you see?

                RAMA
No--

     Sita quickly ushers him to a spot where the sun doesn't blind the
     two.

                RAMA
Wow. Lakshmana, this is quite the deer.

                SITA
We should capture it! Mira would love a friend. We could name it Maya.
Mira and Maya...what a duo. I'm excited

                LAKSHMANA
            (on deaf ears)
Sita, I don't know. I've hunted many deer before, and this one... it irks me.

                SITA
Rama, would you capture it for me? I'm sure it would appreciate your
many stories... I mean, it's looking right at you.

                RAMA
I don't know. It's been a while since I have hunted. If Lakshmana is
uneasy, that worries

                SITA
Fine. Then I will be sleeping outside with Mira while we wait for Maya to
appear again. Lakshmana can take my place next to you.

                LAKSHMANA
Sita, that's ridiculous--

                RAMA
Lakshmana, sit down.

     Lakshmana has turned around to see Rama sitting in front of the
     dice.

                LAKSHMANA
You can't be serious.

                RAMA
Sit down.

     Reluctantly, Lakshmana sits, bow in hand.

                RAMA
Only two dice. Doubles, we go after the deer.

                LAKSHMANA
I thought we decided not to go after the deer at all.

                RAMA
            (quietly to Lakshmana)
I know you might not believe me, but Sita has not asked for much these
entire thirteen years, and I think I owe her one. Plus, if it is something evil,
I will vanquish it. If not, Sita gets a friend. Either way, now...
            (jiggling dice)
...we don't have to make the decision.


                LAKSHMANA
Fine. Roll.

     Rama rolls the dice. Lakshmana holds his breath.

     Both look at the dice.

                RAMA
Snake eyes.
            (to Sita)
Sita, love, is the deer still there?

                SITA
Yes, and has made friends with Mira, just as I'd hoped!

     Just as Rama got up and grabbed his bow for the first time since
     they arrived at the Dandaka Hut, the deer sprints off. Rama runs
     after

                LAKSHMANA
Ok, since Rama's gone, you're under my care.

                SITA
I am fully capable of taking care of myself.

                LAKSHMANA
Well, I came to the forest for both of your safety.
            (sighs)
If it was Rama here, I would have said the same thing.

     An awkward silence.

                SITA
            (adjusting her garments)
Is that really why you came?

                LAKSHMANA
            (quick to defend)
Yes.

                SITA
It's...admirable.

                LAKSHMANA
I'm glad you think so.

                SITA
Rama needs a brother like you.

     Lakshmana smiles.

                LAKSHMANA
We keep each other in line. When we were younger, I'd always make sure
to support him whenever he made a difficult decision. He has this habit of
being... overly truthful. He can never tell a lie. I personally don't
understand it, but it has gotten him into some serious trouble. So, yes, I've
come to support

                SITA
It's as if he's the 'golden star' in his own drama. Title? 'Rama's Journey.'

     Lakshmana bursts out laughing. The two continue to joke.

     Simultaneously, out of view from the Hut, we hear Rama's heavy
     breathing as he closes in on the illusive deer. It stops, yet right as
     he is about to draw back his bow, the deer stares into his soul.

     Rama forces himself to close his eyes, and only then does he
     release the

     The deer screeches.

     As Rama approaches the fallen deer, a woman can be heard
     gasping for air. Confused, Rama runs up to the unidentifiable
     woman.

                RAMA
            (to unknown woman)
What-!
            (towards Hut)
Sita! Lakshmana! Help me!
            (attempting to save the woman)
No, no,  stay with me. My brother Lakshmana will come to help us. He
always carries herbs with him, and Sita will bring water.

     As Rama is per-occupied with tending the wound, the woman
     suddenly brings Rama for a kiss but hesitates to close the gap.
     Rama realizes who it

                SURPANAKHA
I'm so sorry, Rama. Save her. Save her, please!

     Rama is stunned.

                SURPANAKHA
            (with deep sorrow)
No, no, you're already too late. It's too late!

                SITA
            (back at the hut)
You aren't just here for Rama!

     Sita and Lakshmana are in the middle of an argument. All we
     know is that it started when Rama called out Lakshmana's name.

                LAKSHMANA
            (in the doorway of the hut)
Sita, what are you talking about? I am here to protect you, now come
inside the hut with me,

                SITA
Rama needs you, why are you not going to help? So much for being there
for your

                LAKSHMANA
I know Rama better than anyone, and his shout was not one of pain. I need
to make sure you're safe before I go

                SITA
Safe? Safe and sound within your arms? You're an anarya--a disgrace--if
you think I'm going in there with you when Rama could be out there
dying.

                LAKSHMANA
Sita--

                SITA
            (slight pause)
You've been waiting for this moment, haven't you? You and Kaikeyi
conspiring--

                LAKSHMANA
How dare you accuse me of such a deviant act! I may not be as 'perfect' as
Rama himself, but I have never lied to you. Ever. My duty is to protect
you just as much it is to protect Rama, and not once have I ever had such
sinful

                SITA
Then prove it! Prove you're here to protect your brother, and not just to
steal the crown and

     Lakshmana grabs his weapons from the hut and darts off to find
     Rama. Sita sits quietly on the

     His heart; that's all Rama hears as he attempts to make his way
     back to the Hut. The sun is no longer above the horizon and
     suddenly Rama struggles to find his way back.

     As if circling the Hut, the princes run to find each other. The hut
     now the only place lit by the growing moon.

     A gold ring falls from the sky in front of Rama's path. A
     lovebird, in the midst of mating, screams as his lover falls from
     the branch, a now bloody mess being struck by the ring. Rama
     freezes in horror as the bird mourns. Rama goes to pick up the
     bloody ring and immediately recognizes the engravings: It's
     Sita's.

                LAKSHMANA
Rama! There you are!

                RAMA
We've made a grave error.

                LAKSHMANA
What's wrong?

     Lakshmana follows Rama's gaze towards the sky.

                LAKSHMANA
Come, Sita is waiting for you.

                RAMA
Why did you leave her?

     Suddenly, Rama's wrathful gaze lands on Lakshmana.

                LAKSHMANA
She--she said I was conspiring with mother Kaikeyi to have you killed!
She accused me of lusting for her, and said to run after you to prove my
dignity.

                RAMA
That is an incorrect answer, Lakshmana.

     Rama shows Lakshmana the ring.

                LAKSHMANA
Oh, God, what have we done?

     Both men run back towards the Hut to find it destroyed.
     Suddenly, the world begins to shrink in fear of Rama's wrath.

                RAMA
            (scrambling to find Sita and her
             things)
You... imbecile!

                LAKSHMANA
Me?! You're the one who thought it was a good idea to run after the deer
in the first

                RAMA
You had one job, Lakshmana! One. Job. How the hell could you screw me
over like this?

     Lakshmana is at a loss for words.

                RAMA
Don't just stand there, FIND HER!

                LAKSHMANA
            (Runs off to find Sita)
Sita! Maa Sita, I'm sorry! Please come back!

     We follow Rama as he peels over all the damage. It's clear
     someone has taken

     (Rama's Solo. Similar in spirit to "No Good Deed" performed by
     Indina Menzel in Wicked.

     Rama grabs his weapons; he swears he will destroy everything in
     his path until he finds Sita and proves to his Father above that he
     is still the princely kyshatriya Dasaratha has always seen in him.
     Ultimately, it's a song of deep pain.

     His last saving grace has been stolen.

                        END OF ACT 3.

### Hello!

#### Welcome to the *Treta Yuga*: the age before the End.

##### In Prince Rama's humanistic world, Love isn't quite just, kings aren't always the ones in charge, and the fallacies of being human seem to push his life further into chaos.
Love comes in many forms, and some are more important than others. Rama's success--as a King to his subjects, or as a Lover to his Wife--is up for him to decide: be the human hero he's always seen in himself, or to accept his Fate: to become the *Avatara* the rest of the humanity needs him to be.

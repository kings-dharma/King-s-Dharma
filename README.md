# RAMAYANA - A King's Dharma
## A multi-media musical based upon Valmiki's *Ramayana*.
Stageplay written by Zeezee Canning (zeezeeazc123)

### Hello!

#### Welcome to the *Treta Yuga*: the age before the End.

#### In Prince Rama's humanistic world, Love isn't quite just, becoming king doesn't always put you in charge, and the fallacies of living as human seem to push his life further into chaos.
Love comes in many forms, and some are more important than others. Rama's success--as a king to his subjects or a loving husband to his wife--is up for him to decide. Lord Vishnu's 7th *Avatara* must choose to be the faliable hero he's always seen in himself, or to accept his Fate as the divine savior in an unforgiving, human world.

#### Experiencing Ancient Intentions - A note from the Writer

"One of the most amusing facts about Valmiki's *Ramayana* is that he is in it, and not just as a spectator; he is integral to the plot. He sees two love-birds making love, only to witness one being shot by a human hunter. Of course, Valmiki is grief-stricken from witnessing the separation of the innocent lovers, and such *bhava*--such emotions and sensations--is what prompts him to write the *Ramayana*, an embodiment of such sensitivies (*rasa*). Without having experienced such emotion, the *Ramayana* would have never been born.

"The emotions that drive Valmiki to write the *Ramayana* are important. Each emotion finds itself in every character, fuels every action, and ultimately drives the Fate of our beloved heroes whose struggles uncannily mirror the challenges that we face today. **If we can understand Valmiki's intentions, we can better connect with the story itself.**

"Although there have been a multitude of multimedia re-imaginings, from TV shows to movies, none fully capture Valmiki's intentions. **To do so, the audience must *experience* the story, not just imagine (or see) it.** Obviously, this is easier said than done. However, with the right technology (see below), interdisciplinary mindset, and some good-old creative problem-solving, we can create a unique, live experience--the mode Valmiki originally intended it to be.

As Valmiki has suggested, like Rama, it feels as if we are living close to the End. So, it is time to experience timelessness--from feeling the wrath of nine ghostly heads on stage to the universality of *dharma*--and not just watch it."
